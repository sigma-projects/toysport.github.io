<h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue"><font size="4">Toyota 
Marine Sports' VT300i 4.0-liter</font></span></b></h1>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial">Toyota power has been used in the air, land, 
and sea.&nbsp; Officially on land based vehicles of all sorts, unofficially in the 
air and water…until now.&nbsp; The old K engines have powered boats of all types in 
Asia, the M engines have powered speed boats all over the world.&nbsp; Now officially 
Toyota has produced a marine engine and boat !</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial">The heart of Toyota Marine Sports' boats is 
its VT300i 4.0-liter, V8 engine with 300 horsepower and 310 ft. lbs. of torque. 
The VT300i engine is a marine version of the 1UZFE VVTi engine used to power 
several Lexus automobiles. With hundreds of thousands of Lexus vehicles on the 
road, the engine has proven to be a standard of reliability and long life. 
Additionally, each marine engine is individually tested twice before it leaves 
the factory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial">This engine (and the automotive version 
similarly featured in the Lexus LS 400, GS 400 and SC 400) is fitted with twin 
double overhead camshafts and Variable Valve Timing with Intelligence (VVTi) for 
improved pulling power over a wide RPM range. What this proven power unit means 
for the boat driver is rapid throttle response with no RPM fall-off when towing.
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial">The VT300i&nbsp; has its own version of 
&quot;fly-by-wire&quot; when it comes to throttle response. The Electronic Control Unit 
(ECU) controls intake throttle valve position using a potentiometer and 
electrical motor. The boat throttle cable connects to the potentiometer, and any 
movement of throttle varies an electrical signal sent to the ECU. The ECU, in 
turn, controls a DC electric motor connected to the throttle valve assembly. The 
throttle valve moves through a zero degree (idle) to 84 degree (full-throttle) 
angle. In fail-safe mode, the throttle angle is automatically set at 24 degrees 
for limited engine operation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial">The ECU continuously adjusts the intake 
valve timing. Timing is changed hydraulically using two VVTi controller units 
consisting of an outer gear, an inner gear, a helical splined hydraulic piston 
and electronic/hydraulic circuits for directing oil to one or the other side of 
the piston. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial">The outer gear is driven by the engine 
timing belt, and inner gears are connected to the intake camshaft. A moveable 
piston, with helical cut splines, is located between these gears and is pushed 
in or out by hydraulic pressure directionally controlled by the ECU. As the 
piston moves in or out, the helical splines continuously reposition the inner 
gear to outer gear position relationship thus changing intake camshaft timing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial">The VT300i is a 90-degree bank, 32-valve V8 
gasoline engine featuring state-of-the-art engine management and operating 
systems. It features an onboard computer with built-in malfunction diagnostics, 
electronically controlled distributorless ignition, continuous variable valve 
timing for maximum performance and intake air assisted, sequential fuel 
injection. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial">For reliability, there is no distributor 
assembly, and each spark plug has an individual ignition coil and igniter 
controlled by the ECU. The ECU electronically monitors crankshaft RPM, camshaft 
angle, throttle valve position and other critical engine information in 
determining the optimum spark advance curve. For long life (approximately 1,500 
engine hours), the spark plug center tips are constructed of iridium and the 
outer electrodes are made of platinum. Twin engine block-mounted knock sensors 
detect engine knocking with the ECU adjusting ignition timing and RPM to protect 
the engine from damage. A highly reliable powerplant, even the serpentine drive 
belt is rated with a 100,000-mile life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial">Even the intake air induction is 
acoustically controlled for improved performance. The (ACIS) or Acoustic 
Controlled Induction System increases the power output at all RPMs. The intake 
manifold has a built-in adjustable bulkhead (door) that divides the intake 
manifold into long and short tube lengths. Using an intake air control valve, 
this bulkhead is opened or closed depending on engine RPM and throttle valve 
position. Long-intake runners are used below 4,900 RPM with short runner lengths 
being used above.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial">The VT300i features Toyota's Air-Assisted, 
Sequential Multi-Port Fuel Injection (SFI) using Four Hole Injectors. A 
combination hot wire-type air flow meter/temperature sensor (located in the air 
intake system) measures intake air volume and temperature for precisely 
controlled fuel injection timing. To improve fuel economy, idle mode and to 
reduce emissions, a small amount of intake air is directed to each fuel injector 
based on the position of the throttle valve. The system's target is to optimize 
combustion at all loads and RPM conditions. Maximum performance is assured with 
the Pentroof combustion chamber with the sparkplug located in the center between 
valves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial">Vapor lock protection is provided by using 
two separate electric fuel pumps. A continuous flow primary fuel pump 
recirculates fuel from and back to the boat fuel tank. A secondary fuel pump 
provides fuel to the injector rails from the pressurized output of the primary 
pump. Excess injector rail fuel is returned to the fuel tank by the primary 
pump, improving fuel economy. Protection from water in the fuel tank comes from 
an in-line replaceable water separator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial">Although the engine is protected from the 
elements by the hull, additional corrosion protection is afforded by an 
epoxy-based anti-corrosion primer coat with an acrylic top coat. A recent 
addition is an optional self-contained, freshwater cooling system. The engine's 
85 amp alternator keeps the batteries charged, allowing virtually unlimited 
accessory use throughout the day without draining cranking power.&nbsp; The starter 
motor is located on the upper part of the assembly in order to protect it from 
moisture for improved durability and longer life.</span></p>
