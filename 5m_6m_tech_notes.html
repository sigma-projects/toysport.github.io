<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">The 5MGE 2800cc 
  DOHC (dual overhead cam) was introduced in the U.S. Supra in 1982.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>This Twin Cam was also used on the U.S. Cressida in 1983.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>This engine was the first production 6 cylinder Toyota Twin Cam- since 
  the 3M Toyota 2000GT (a limited production model).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>This power plant was one of the main reasons the Supra became very popular, 
  and a Toyota milestone model.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In 
  1984 the EFI (electronic fuel injection) was updated to a digital system and 
  the compression raised, this brought the horsepower up from 145 to 160.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span><o:p> </o:p> </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">In Japan, a 6MGE 
  3000cc model was introduced in 1986 that was rated at 200 HP.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The engine was identical to the 5MG in design, but related parts to the 
  pistons and crankshaft were different.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>It is interesting to note that the 6MG was rated by Toyota with the same 
  horsepower as the successor 7MGE 3000cc (a 24 valve model) but with a better 
  torque band!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact it used a 
  7MG crankshaft before the 7MG was introduced.<o:p> </o:p> </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">The Twin Cam 
  head is a G type- meaning Sports Type.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Also a first for Toyota-<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>the 
  head featured hydraulic valve adjustment, eliminating the shims (which most 
  mechanics feared).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This engine 
  allowed Toyota to position the Supra above all the other Japanese models and 
  on par with the leading European manufacturers.<o:p> </o:p> </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">Toyota's philosophy 
  in product design, which is based on continuing evolution, shows distinctly 
  in this engine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The M block started 
  life as a 2000cc, became the 2M 2300cc., the 4M 2600cc., and the 5M 2800 cc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The 5MG and 6MG Twin Cam (12 valves), which preceded the 7MG (24 valves), 
  allowed Toyota Twin Cam power in a whole new market segment (the 6 cylinder 
  Twin Cam heads were previously available only in the 3M).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Toyota's vaunted dependability and reliability is evolved.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The Twin Cam head is a crowning act on Toyota's legendary block.<o:p> 
  </o:p> </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">In competition 
  we used the 5MG-powered Supras for showroom stock racing (SCCA SSA) and in the 
  IMSA Firestone Endurance Series.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 
  cars ran trouble free, won a lot of races, and even held track records in Willow 
  Springs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(In fact Nissan supplied 
  us with an Anniversary 300ZX to campaign also, but it was not as successful.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>As a real GT (Grand Touring) the 5MG was incomparable to any engine in 
  its class.<o:p> </o:p> </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">This engine ignited 
  a lot of interest for aftermarket parts manufacturers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Engine kits for 2900cc and even 3100cc were available, but very expensive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Powerboat racing saw many 5MGs screaming in open sea events- another 
  testimony to the engines durability.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In 
  power boat racing the engines are revving flat-out like in 1<sup>st</sup> gear 
  all the time.<o:p> </o:p></font></p>

THE 5MG/ 6MG<o:p>
 </font><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">
 </o:p>
</font></b></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">Block:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The 5<sup>th</sup> generation 5MG has a tested and proven bottom end.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The 5MG responds extremely well to the 2900cc conversion or the 3100cc 
  engine kit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In 2900cc form we have 
  proved that the Supra will out accelerate Mustangs and Camaros in the racetracks 
  and actually outrace them on the straights. Basic block preparation is all that 
  is needed, no secrets here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 
  head gasket can cause serious wear on the block surface, so it is a good idea 
  to deck them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A cost effective 
  upgrade is to go 6MG.<o:p> </o:p> </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">Although the 
  6MG looks externally similar- internal components are different.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>You cannot drop a 6MG crank on a 5MG without changing related pieces- 
  timing cover, pulleys, pistons, etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For 
  practical and cost purposes if you want to have 3000cc., get a complete 6MG. 
  The 5MG / 6MG has a durable bottom end and will out last the cylinder heads 
  before needing attention.<o:p> </o:p> </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">Cylinder Head: 
  The cylinder heads suffer from abnormal wear from carbon build up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The EGR causes oil to deteriorate sooner than some engines and leaves 
  a lot of accumulated carbon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Prepare 
  the head with a port and polish treatment, this is a good value in terms of 
  added performance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Headers and 
  exhaust systems will help allow the engine to breath since the cars they powered 
  were tuned for quiet GT luxury touring.<o:p> </o:p> </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">The 6MG intake 
  manifold uses bigger intake runners.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This 
  will bolt to the 5MG head, but does not have provisions for EGR.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>In fact, if you are upgrading to a 6MG- you have to transfer all the 
  related 5MG EGR pieces to the new engines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Everything is transferable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Make 
  sure that the EGR is clean and decarbonized- it will ensure passing smog requirements. 
  <o:p> </o:p> </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">There are aftermarket 
  cams available, but unless the compression is raised the cams are of no use.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Adjustable cam gears are also mandatory because these engines are very 
  sensitive to camshaft settings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 
  cam towers need close inspection during rebuilding.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Since the cams have a tendency to wear out- the towers may also be bad.<o:p> 
  </o:p> </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">Turbo-upgrade:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>For all-out power Turbo charging is the way to go.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Mandatory forged pistons will allow the engine to see and survive boost 
  levels higher than the 7MGTE.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>An 
  advantage is that the valves are bigger (although less in number) which will 
  survive the heat better than the smaller valves of the 7MGTE (24 valves).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Under boost the advantage of 24 valves is minimized.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>EFI upgrades are necessary to maintain the correct A/F ratio.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>There are Twin Turbo manifolds available from HKS and we have a couple 
  remaining, this includes a new plenum!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Properly set-up, a 5MG Turbocharged easily outrun 7MGTs similarly equipped 
  with upgrades (the bodies were considerably lighter and the engines responded 
  better- pound for pound of boost.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p> 
  </o:p> </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">Fuel System:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The fuel injection system was upgraded in the later models, but the effect 
  on performance was from raised compression.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Unless the engine is turbocharged there is no need for any modification.<o:p> 
  </o:p> </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">Ignition System:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Any modified engine will need step colder spark plugs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The standard ignition is adequate, but can be supplemented with ignition 
  upgrades.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Although advancing the 
  timing setting helps, be conservative (past the factory specs) since the knock 
  sensors will automatically retard the ignition.<o:p> </o:p></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><b><font color="#0000FF">Some 
  Recommended Set-ups:</font></b></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">For Stock configuration-<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The six cylinder in-line engine is a smooth power plant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The Twin Cam head allows it to rev much higher than any head configuration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>This provides a smooth and powerful power source.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Upgrade to the 84 pistons if you need to oversize.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The cylinder head can be ported with no effect on emissions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Use a machine shop that is experienced in working with these aluminum 
  heads and thoroughly inspect the cam towers also.<o:p> </o:p> </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">For Modified 
  configuration-<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 2900cc piston 
  set or the 3100cc will be the ultimate set-up in naturally aspirated form.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>These will produce over 230 (2.9L) / 250 (3.1L) HP with no further modifications.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Head preparation must be done to allow the bigger displacement to breathe 
  properly.<o:p> </o:p> </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">The 6MG is a 
  cost effective alternative.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 
  fuel injection system on the late 5MG and 6MG are the same, to install the 6MG 
  in an early 5MG- all the sensors including the TPS (throttle positioner sensor) 
  must be transferred.<o:p> </o:p> </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">For Racing configuration-<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Race regulations allow specific limited modifications.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>If allowed the displacement upgrades will be ideal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Radical camshafts will need a reprogrammed ECU or an entirely new one 
  (Tech II or similar unit).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Anticipated 
  horsepower over 400 will need new connecting rods, the crankshaft will be fine 
  with correct bearing clearances and chamfered oil holes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Disable the EGR.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We have 
  available a limited number of Triple side draft manifolds- which will also need 
  a direct fire ignition system (since the distributor is disabled).<o:p> </font><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><font color="#000000"> </o:p>
