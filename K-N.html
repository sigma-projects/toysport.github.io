<p><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font size="2">The 
  primary function of an air filter is to clean the air before it enters the engine. 
  If this is true, why do we see so many engines, especially expensive competition 
  engines, without air filters? The answer is airflow. An engine's power output 
  is proportional to the volume of air it can ingest at any given rpm, assuming 
  the fuel management system is capable of sustaining a near perfect air/fuel 
  mixture ratio. The most minute restriction in the air induction system will 
  cause an engine's optimum power output to drop. <o:p> </o:p> </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font size="2">Maintaining 
  optimum, unrestricted flow becomes a problem when the air must pass through 
  a filter element. Conventional paper elements are very resistant to air flow 
  because the filter material or medium is very dense. The greater the restriction 
  the greater the power loss. <o:p> </o:p> </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font size="2">K&N 
  engineers have made vast improvements in performance, durability and serviceability 
  by directly addressing these inherent compromises. In the early '60s, K&N 
  developed an oil impregnated cotton air filter gauze which exceeds the minimum 
  filtration standards while offering little restriction to air flow. As a result, 
  the first K&N filter element was manufactured by sandwiching several layers 
  of surgical gauze between two sheets of wire mesh. The medium was then pleated 
  to reduce the filter's overall size and to increase its surface area. Finally 
  the cotton gauze was oiled to enhance it's filtering capabilities. The original 
  concept exists today and remains the basic component used in all of our automotive, 
  industrial, marine and motorcycle air filters. <o:p> </o:p> </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font size="2">K&N's 
  oil-impregnated, cotton-gauze element is the basis of our filter, as well as 
  K&N's overall dominance of the reusable air filter market. The process is 
  expensive but well worth the effort. To further make the point, consider that 
  square inch per square inch, our filter will flow an average of 50 percent more 
  air compared to the average paper filter without sacrificing filtration efficiency.

<p><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font size="2">By 
  comparison, paper filters are made from compressed fibers. The spaces between 
  these fibers provide microscopic holes the air must pass through. One by one, 
  these holes become plugged with dirt and dust particles. Once a hole becomes 
  plugged, the air must find an alternate route through the medium. As the filter 
  collects more dirt, its resistance to air flow increases because there are fewer 
  and fewer holes left open and as restriction goes up, horsepower and fuel economy 
  go down. But to meet minimum filtration standards, the paper must be thick and/or 
  the fibers must be tightly compressed and dense. Therefore paper elements that 
  provide adequate filtration are restrictive to air flow by design. Any paper 
  element that could flow as much air as an equivalent K&N would not provide 
  safe filtration. Additionally, as a paper filter becomes more and more clogged, 
  the pressure inside the filter drops while the atmospheric air pressure (approximately 
  14.6 psig at sea level) outside the filter remains the same. It's like using 
  your lungs to draw the air out of a plastic milk bottle. When the pressure differential 
  becomes too great, the bottle will collapse. The same thing could happen to 
  your paper filter, although it is unlikely. But what will happen could be just 
  as severe. An excessively high pressure differential created by a restricted 
  filter can literally pull dirt particles through the paper medium. In other 
  words, the performance of a paper filter, i.e. air flow through the filter and 
  its ability to protect your engine, DECREASES near the end of its service interval.
