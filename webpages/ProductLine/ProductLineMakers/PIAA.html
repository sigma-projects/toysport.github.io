<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Technology<br>
Who's the proven leader in auxiliary lighting? PIAA. Discerning drivers indicate 
that PIAA's Ion Crystal™ technology far surpasses the fog light performance of 
traditional amber lenses. Likewise, PIAA's Platinum Series &quot;Super White&quot; 
technology provides a white light approaching the brightness and intensity of 
High Intensity Discharge (H.I.D.) lamps at a fraction of the cost.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Race Proven Quality<br>
Dependable and reliable under the most severe racing conditions,&quot; note racing 
professionals. PIAA quality makes PIAA lighting systems the serious driver's 
choice. PIAA lenses are computer designed for optimum performance and are made 
of hardened prism cut glass to withstand the rigors of off road racing and 
normal highway hazards. PIAA's lamps feature a specially designed polyphenylene 
sulfide composite, aluminum or stamped steel housing. These materials make it 
possible for the lamps to operate using higher wattage bulbs without sacrificing 
bulb life.<br>

You don't have to be an automotive electrician to install PIAA light kits. &quot;It's 
easy&quot; say PIAA customers.<br>

and bulbs approach the color and intensity of High Intensity Discharge (H.I.D.). 
You'll be &quot;styling&quot; with this cutting-edge technology.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">High Intensity Discharge<br>
PIAA is proud to introduce a new generation of High Intensity Discharge (H.I.D.) 
driving lamps. If your looking for the most advanced lighting technology on the 
market today then look no further than PIAA's new H.I.D. system. The first thing 
you'll notice about PIAA's new H.I.D. system is its compact size and contoured 
lens. But don't let the compact size fool you. PIAA's new H.I.D. system utilizes 
a 35watt bulb, which produces light output equal to a 150watt system. PIAA's new 
H.I.D. driving light with its superior performance, compact size, and 
affordability is the ultimate choice of serious automotive enthusiasts.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dual Lamp Technology<br>

allow you to switch easily between fog and driving lights in order to meet 
changing light and road conditions. PIAA offers the most extensive selection of

When you're driving in inclement weather, PIAA's Ion Crystal Technology greatly 
enhances visibility and safety. This technology transforms white light into 
amber light without diminishing the strength of the beam, providing greater 
output than a standard dyed lens. Whether roughing it at work or play, PIAA's 
Ion Crystal Technology is a smart addition to any vehicle.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Xtreme White<br>
PIAA's new Xtreme White Technology is the closest color yet to H.I.D. (High
