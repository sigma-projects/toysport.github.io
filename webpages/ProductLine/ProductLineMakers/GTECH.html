<p><span style="font-family:Arial"><b><font size="2">G-TECH/Pro is an electronic Performance Meter
for automobiles. It's designed to make a professional test driver out of
anybody. All you have to do is plug it in a cigarette lighter, mount it to the
windshield and start accelerating. G-TECH/Pro does the rest automatically and
displays the results. It's a great way to get performance and safety information
about you car for only $139.95!</font><o:p><font size="2"> </font>
</o:p>
</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial; font-weight:700"><font size="2">We are very proud of the all new G-TECH/Pro.
The responses to the Pro have been phenomenal. Magazines are raving about it.
Customers are loving it. New Digital Signal Processing algorithms coupled with
Gold Plated Circuitry and a Precision Silicon Accelerometer insure impeccable
accuracy. Best of all, we still have the old price.</font><o:p><font size="2">
</font>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:Arial">What can it do?<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial; font-weight:700"><font size="2">G-TECH/Pro takes advantage of many different
measurements that can be gathered from acceleration over time. For Horsepower
measurement the user has to input the weight of the vehicle. We utilize what we
call &quot;Intuitive User Interface&quot;. To input weight all you have to do is
simply tilt G-TECH/Pro up and the numbers will increase and if you tilt it down
the numbers will decrease. Further you tilt it faster the numbers change.<br>
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><br>
In Horsepower mode G-TECH/Pro will display currently delivered horsepower during
acceleration and then when you slow down it will display maximum delivered
horsepower.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All the measurements
are performed automatically. All you have to do is push the button indicating to
G-TECH/Pro that you are ready and then G-TECH/Pro will zero-out and display
-GO-. Then simply start accelerating. G-TECH/Pro will know your speed and
distance at any given moment and stop the measurement at 60 mph or 1/4 mile
point.<br>
<br>
While measuring Lateral or Longitudinal G's user has the choice of Instantaneous
or Continuous mode. Instantaneous G's are great for analyzing when tires lost
traction during braking and cornering or measuring any other kind of G-load.
Continuous G's are designed for standard Skidpad handling measurements of
Lateral G's.<br>
<br>
When measuring Braking distance in feet user doesn't have to start braking
exactly at 60 mph. G-TECH/Pro knows the speed always and it will only measure
distance from 60-0 mph even if you started braking at 65 mph for example.</font><o:p><font size="2">
</font>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:Arial">How does it work?<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></b></p>
<p>
<span style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;; font-weight:700">
<font size="2">The
heart of the G-TECH/Pro is a precision silicon accelerometer. An accelerometer
is a sensor that measures acceleration, also known as G-Force. G-Force is what's
keeping you in your seat as you are reading these words and if it wasn't for the
seat you would be accelerating to the ground at 1G (32 feet per second per
second).<br>
<br>
G-TECH/Pro measures your speed and distance traveled by integrating acceleration
over time. Basically, if you know how fast you are accelerating for a certain
time period you'll know how much your speed has changed after that time period.
So, if you start of from zero speed then you'll know what your speed is after
every time period. These time periods are very small (2.5 milliseconds) and
that's how G-TECH/Pro maintains its accuracy.<br>
<br>
Distance is measured in the same fashion, if you know how fast you are going for
a certain time period you will know what is the distance traveled during that
time period.<br>
<br>
G-TECH/Pro also measures delivered Horsepower, sometimes called Rear Wheel
Horsepower. This horsepower includes the loss of power through the drivetrain
which is usually 10-15%. The formula for Horsepower is speed times acceleration
times the weight of the vehicle.</font><o:p><font size="2"> </font>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">What
about accuracy?<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
<font size="2"><b>The
best way to look at accuracy is in two different ways. Resolution is the
smallest segment of a given measurement that G-TECH/Pro can sense. Real Life
accuracy is the worst case scenario to be expected in your measurements.<br>
The difference between Resolution and Real Life accuracy is the
result of noise, temperature dependency, vibration and other elements that
influence the accelerometer and other internal electronic circuitry. </b></font> <o:p>

<span style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;; font-weight:700">
<font size="2">Our
accelerometer is one of the best in the world. It starts out as a 1/8 inch
silicone cube. Then it's laser sliced in to a sandwich with the critical mass in
the middle. It sits in the specially designed silicone gel with dampening
characteristics tailored for automotive dynamics. On top of all this there is a
special accelerometer enclosure with grounded metal layer for EMI shielding.<br>
We at TESLA Electronics believe that the best way to insure accuracy is to get a
good, clean signal from the outside world and that's why the accelerometer in
the G-TECH/Pro costs more than all other parts put together.</font><o:p><font size="2">

<p><b><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">What's
the maximum G range of the G-TECH/Pro?</span></b><span style="font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><br>
<br>
<b><font size="2">In order to achieve such high accuracy Maximum G range of G-TECH/Pro is ~1.3
G's. This is fine for all the cars who's 1/4 mile E.T.'s are above 7 seconds.
If you have a car that's below 7 seconds you may experience inaccurate
measurements due to clipping. Clipping is when the amount of G-Forces exceeds
the limits of G-TECH/Pro. This can't hurt G-TECH/Pro but it can upset the
measurements. Clipping will manifest itself by longer times than expected.<br>
</font></b>
<br>
<b>Can G-TECH/Pro be used on motorcycles?</b><br>
<br>
<b><font size="2">This question is somewhat related to the one above. Some motorcycles deliver G's
that exced 1.3 G range. G-TECH/Pro wasn't designed for use with motorcycles.
However, some customers have used it with motorcycles with success. It's very
hard to say what G's (and for how long) can your motorcycle deliver even if you
know it's E.T.'s. In this case our Risk Free Money Back Guarantee can come in
handy.<br>
</font></b>
<br>
<b>Why is my G-TECH/Pro consistently 2-3 mph above the track?<br>
</b><br>
<b><font size="2">G-TECH/Pro is a very accurate machine, and the trap speed result that you get
from the G-TECH/Pro is actually more accurate than the racetrack. Reason is that
the racetrack averages your speed over a 60 feet stretch between two beams and
G-TECH/Pro measures your speed at the exact 1/4 mile point.<br>
<br>
</font>How do I update my regular G-TECH to G-TECH/Pro?<br>
<br>
</b>
<font size="2">All you have to do is send your G-TECH to TESLA Electronics, Accu-Sembly
Inc., 4123 Rowland Ave. El Monte, CA 91731 and include a note with your address
and a $40 payment (includes shipping) and we will take care of the rest.</font><o:p><font size="2">
