<p align="left"><b><font size="2">With over 30 years of experience and nearly 1,700 products,
Moroso is your one-stop performance source for Drag and Oval Track Racing,
Street Machines, and Show Cars. Our race-proven products are designed and
manufactured with a formidable combination of computer-controlled equipment,
quality materials, and expert craftsmanship. </font></b> <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p align="left"><b><font size="2">As a leader in innovation, Moroso has developed many products
that have become commonplace in racing today such as deep sump oil pans, tall
valve covers, electric water pumps, solid motor mounts, and many more. This
innovative tradition continues as Moroso engineers continually develop new
products through our close working relationship with the nation's top engine
builders and race teams. Extensive research and development, on-track testing,
and a steadfast commitment to quality are the cornerstones on which Moroso has
earned its reputation for over three decades.</font><o:p><font size="2"> </font>

</p>
<p align="left"><b><font size="2">Moroso Performance Products is one of the worlds most respected
suppliers of automotive equipment for racing and street performance
applications. Moroso manufacturers nearly 1700 products, from oil pans and
oiling system accessories, to valve covers, ignition components, fuel system
equipment, air cleaners, hard core racing tools and numerous other performance
parts. The company has an impressive list of customers, ranging from grass-roots
racers to top level NASCAR Winston Cup and NHRA/IHRA race teams. In addition to
the Connecticut based manufacturing operation, the company also owns Moroso
Motorsports Park located in West Palm Beach, Florida. This is a multi-use
facility including a 2.25 mile, ten turn road course and a state-of-the-art NHRA
sanctioned drag strip.&nbsp;</font><o:p><font size="2"> </font>

</b>
</p>
<p align="left"><b><font size="2">Moroso was started in 1968 by Dick Moroso, one of the most
successful modified production drag racers on record. Dick left his racing
career to design, test and manufacture specialized products aimed exclusively at
racer's needs. Racers quickly recognized that Moroso products were a cut above
the others because they were designed and built for racers - by racers!&nbsp;</font><o:p><font size="2">
</font>
</o:p>
</b>
</p>
<p align="left"><b><font size="2">Dick Moroso was responsible for many innovations in the high
performance industry. He was instrumental in nurturing the warehouse
distribution (WD) network, which became an integral step in supplying the
growing number of speed shops appearing in every corner of the country. In
addition, Moroso pioneered several racing products including deep-sump oil pans,
electric water pumps, tall valve covers, lightweight front drag tires, racing
vacuum pumps, and others.</font><o:p><font size="2"> </font>
</o:p>
</b>
</p>
<p align="left"><b><font size="2">In November 1998, while the company was celebrating its 30th
anniversary, Dick Moroso lost a year-long battle with cancer.</font><o:p><font size="2">
</font>
</o:p>
</b>
</p>
<p align="left"><b><font size="2">The Moroso tradition of innovation, quality and integrity is
carried forward by his son Rick, who in 1997 was named president of Moroso
Performance Products. Rick also carries on the Moroso drag racing legacy,
campaigning the seriously updated 1961 Corvette that his dad raced during the
60's.</font><o:p><font size="2"> </font>
</o:p>
</b>
</p>
<p align="left"><b><font size="2">The Moroso heritage also continues in manufacturing and quality
control. Computer systems with the latest CAD/CAM software have replaced the
drafting tables and the Moroso plant is now filled with sophisticated CNC
machinery including turret punch presses, turning centers, lathes and robotic
welders. The combination of highly skilled craftsmen and highly accurate
machinery guarantees that the tradition of quality started by Dick Moroso over 
30 years ago will continue throughout the coming decades.</font><o:p><font size="2">

Morosp looks forward to the future you can count on Moroso's continued
