<h1>BOMEX</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>About Bomex:</b> Tuning 
Aero Parts Alligator Company is one of the very few if not the only one body kit 
company in Japan who does everything in house from design to manufacturing. More 
than 400 items and adding are distributed under it's own brand Bomex (Two Door 
Sports), Bomex USA (SUV and Mini Vans), and Bomex Executive (Four Door Sports). 
Alligator Co. also produces over 120 items for 11 companies under OEM contracts. 
Alligator Co. started in 1987 as a subcontractor and begin to release it's own 
line of products under Bomex brand in 1992. The first Bomex original was S13 
Silvia. From 1989 to 1992, Alligator attended Bonneville time trials as 
technical support to RS Yamamoto. In 1991, Greddy Z records 395.6km/h.&nbsp; 1993 
Dual light type 300Z body kit captures design award at Tokyo Auto Salon. 1995 
introduces &quot;Big Mouth&quot; style front bumper. 1996 to now, supporting RE Amemiya in 
GT races (300hp class). RE Amemiya GT is on a cover of &quot;Sony Play Station&quot; game 
&quot;Option 2&quot; released January 1999 and part of &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; released November 
1999. 2000, supports Civic and Collora in GT races. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Design and Manufacturing Concepts:</b> While &quot;Dress Up&quot; body kits concentrate on looks, BOMEX Original Tuning 
Aero Parts are designed and manufactured for performance as well. Cooling, 
reduced air turbulence, down force, etc. are important consideration on drawing 
board to manufacturing. Installation instruction and installation parts are 
supplied with each piece. Sumio Niwa, owner of Alligator Co. believes that 
fiberglass is the best material at this time for tuning orientated body kit. 
Factory type ABS resin is cost prohibitive for aftermarket application. Urethane 
is well suited for dress up purposes but too heavy and not hard enough to hold 
it's shape under high speed. Niwa has chosen high strength, light weight 
fiberglass for BOMEX Original Tuning Aero Parts. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>BOMEX Slogan (FYI):</b>&nbsp;Before Alligator Co. began to market body kits under &quot;Bomex&quot; brand, &quot;Bomex&quot; was 
a symbol of Japanese street racers. Many notable street racers belonged to 
&quot;Explosive Club&quot; worshiped(?) god of &quot;Bomex&quot; to have courage and good luck to 
come out as a winner on often dangerous races. &quot;Pray to the god of Bomex. I hope 
your speed over the rival&quot; = &quot;Pray to the god of Bomex to be explosive as bomb. 
I hope God of Bomex helps my speed to over my rival&quot; &quot;My car cover with complete 
aero parts&quot; = &quot;I wish to have ultimate body kit&quot;</font></p>
