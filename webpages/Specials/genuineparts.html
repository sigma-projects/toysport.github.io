to the ownership experience with excitement of upgrading, without any

Accessories are manufactured or produced by different Toyota National 
Distributors.&nbsp; </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial">Toysport supports Toyota enthusiasts / 
owners worldwide with original Toyota parts and accessories from the different 
Toyota National Parts Distributors.&nbsp; Market destination of the different Toyota 
vehicles dictates what is available for the particular models in the different 
marketing regions.&nbsp; This has been the most prolific source of “original quality” 
Toyota parts for our customers- but also the most frustrating and inaccessible 
source.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">There are many different 
Toyota models sold in various versions throughout the world- North American, 
European, Asian, Oceanic, Japanese, General Market, and some other 
sub-categories.&nbsp; <span style="color: black">Naturally there are different 
variations on even the most common replacement parts.&nbsp; </span>There is a wealth 
of unique market changes that allow you to make your vehicle, subtlety different 
or totally foreign.&nbsp; Toysport is your direct link to all these parts.<b>&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="color: black">To prevent any issues or 
problems with any Toyota organization- Toyota parts imported by Toysport carry 
NO Toyota Part numbers.&nbsp; This is to prevent warranty and liability issues for 
the respective TOYOTA National Parts Distributors in the various countries.&nbsp; 
There is absolutely no warranty on these parts, from Toysport or Toyota.&nbsp; All 
Toyota parts imported by Toysport are labeled and identified as such and are 
sold as SPORT PARTS. Please read our disclaimer.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">The 
different Toyota National Parts Distribution system is tightly inter-linked and 
monitored by Toyota Motor Corp Japan.&nbsp; Genuine replacement parts ordered through 
the different National Distributors are centrally monitored.&nbsp; Although the 
majority of parts originate from Japan- some parts cannot be directly ordered 
from there.&nbsp; Specific parts can only be ordered from specific National 
Distributors.&nbsp; Some parts identified as non-import parts in their respective 
domestic markets need substantial additional paperwork to order- if they can be 
ordered at all. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Toyota parts 
for the different markets are priced differently.&nbsp; Identical and exact Part #s 
maybe priced as much as 50% more between foreign markets.&nbsp; Do not expect to save 
money if the part is available at your national Toyota warehouse or your local 
Toyota dealer.<b> </b>The best source for pricing and warranty is still your 
local TOYOTA dealer.&nbsp; In the U.S. however, Toysport can supply competitively 
priced Toyota, Lexus, and Scion parts and accessories.</span></p>
<h2>Due to the various smog and safety specifications in the different world 
markets, Toysport cannot assume any liability in fitness and legality of these 
imported parts.&nbsp; </h2>
<p><b><span style="font-family: Arial">We reserve the right to refuse any order.
