<p><b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: blue">Toyota 
Twin-Cam Evolution</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Toyota is the largest producer of Twin Cam 
engines. Toyota offers more Twin Cam models than any other manufacturer.</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:Arial">The Beginning</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">The earliest and rarest production Toyota 
Twin Cam engines were the 3M and 9R. Both engines were produced during 1966 to 
1969, and ironically did not carry G engine designations. The 3M was a 2 valve 
Twin Cam 6 cylinder engine with triple Mikunis used in the Toyota 2000 GT. The 
same generic M block, modified through the years became the 2M/4M/5MG/6MG/7MG 
engines- with totally different heads and crankshafts. The 9R was a 2 valve Twin 
Cam 4 cylinder with twin Mikunis used in the Corona 1600GT.&nbsp; The R block was 
Toyotas generic 4 cylinder blocks in the 60’s.&nbsp; Carrying different alpha numeric 
designations- the R blocks were actually a series of totally different blocks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">The Toyota 2000GT established many 
time/distance endurance records.&nbsp; In 1968&nbsp; Carrol Shelby entered some SCCA 
events with 2-cars. &nbsp;The Corona 1600 GT was the original Sport Compact.&nbsp; When 
introduced, the package was unrivalled and unmatched by any other Japanese 
manufacturer.&nbsp; The production runs on the 3M and 9R engines were limited, but it 
showed </span><span style="font-family:
  Arial">Toyota</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> the advantage of the Twin 
Cam design.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:Arial">Mass Production</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">The 2TG and 18RG were the original 
mass-production Toyota Twin Cam engines. At introduction, these were the most 
widely available and produced Twin Cam engines for production cars in the whole 
world.&nbsp; The use of these engines in local (Japan) and regional (Asian) 
competition saw many major victories for Toyota world-wide and at this early 
time predicted Toyota’s future claim as a Technology Driven company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">The 2TG was introduced in Japan 1970 for the 
Corolla / Sprinter series in Japan. It was available in various forms (through 
the years) until 1984. The 1600cc 2TG came with twin-side Mikunis in 2TG, 2TGR, 
and 2TGU models. Eventually it came with fuel injection as a 2TGEU. The last 
model in this series engine was the 3TGTE.&nbsp; TRD and the aftermarket provided 
many parts and 1750cc / 2000 cc conversions were extremely popular.<br>
<br>
The 18RG was first introduced as an 8RG and as an interim 10RG (both 1968cc) in 
1971 for the Celica GT models and the Mark II GSS, respectively. The 2000cc 18RG 
came out in 1974 with twin-side Mikunis in 18RG, 18RGR, and 18RGU models. 
Eventually it came with fuel injection as an 18RGEU. In the US, these were 
popular upgrades in Celicas and Toyota Pick-ups. The 2200cc conversion was very 
popular and some were even setup as 2400cc. Toyota also produced a limited 
number of twin-plug 18RGs that never reached production.<br>
<br>
The 3TGTE replaced the 18RGEU in the Celicas in 1983. The 3TGTE (1770cc), a 
twin-plug version of the classic and trouble-free 8-valve 2TG / 18RG cylinder 
head had a CT20 Turbo, a proprietary Toyota design.&nbsp; The 4TGTE homologation 
version for Toyota's Group B Rally Car had different pistons and crankshaft. 
This engine took Championship honors in the FIA World Rally Cup Group B SuperCar 
series.&nbsp; .&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">These engines were never imported by Toyota 
USA.&nbsp; Through Toysport importations, these engines became very popular in all 
the Corollas, Carinas, Celicas, dune buggies, and Lotus 7 replicas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">The 2nd generation six-cylinder Twin Cam 5MG 
2800 and 6MG 3000 arrived 1982, more than a decade after the 3M.&nbsp; The towering 
cam position looked impressive.&nbsp; The new Twin Cam head-design had innovative 
self-adjusting hydraulic lifters that required no extra maintenance for valve 
adjustment. Service simplicity allowed Toyota to use the engines on many high 
performance sedans, aside from the Supra and Soarer.&nbsp; This marked a significant 
step for Toyota, the first Twin Cams six available across the whole model range.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">In Toyota-techno talk, the numerous letter 
designations quickly identify engine types. After the basic alpha/numeric engine 
family identification: G denotes twin cam “sport”;&nbsp; R for “regular gas”; U for 
‘unleaded” meaning emission controlled; T for turbo;&nbsp; Z for Supercharger;&nbsp; E for 
fuel injection.</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:Arial">Multi-Valves</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Directly transferred from racing activities, 
the 4 valve technology provided an opportunity for a simultaneous evolution of 
Toyota cylinder blocks and heads.&nbsp; (Prior to this point all Toyota blocks were 
basically the 1<sup>st</sup> generation blocks Toyota had for the different 
displacement and cylinder configurations: 4-cylinder K- under 1200, T- under 
1600, R- under 2000; 6 cylinder M- 2000 and up.&nbsp; Ultimately, the K- evolved to 
1800, the T to 1800, the R to 2400, and the M to 3000.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">In 1984, the 4th generation 4 valve Toyota 
Twin Cams, 4AGE/16 and 1GGE/24 were released.&nbsp; Originally designated as “Laser” 
lightweight series, significant changes were also made on the engine blocks- 
compact design, thin wall casting, and lightweight crankshafts.&nbsp; Fortunately 
Toyota decided against aluminum alloy cylinder blocks!&nbsp; The 4AGE 1600 16 Valve 
was followed by a 4AGZE supercharged model.&nbsp; Likewise, the 1GGE 2000 24 Valve 
also had a supercharged version 1GGZE / turbocharged 1GGTE.&nbsp; All these engines 
had&nbsp; “later” model versions, with port reconfiguration and piston changes for 
more HP. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">In 1986, the 3SG 2000 and 7MG 3000 filled in 
the updated 4-valve engine range.&nbsp; Both models were followed by turbocharged 
versions 3SGTE and 7MGTE.&nbsp; The 3SGE/TE also had “later” models versions, with 
port reconfiguration and piston changes for more HP. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">In 1990 the M block was finally replaced by 
the 1JZGE 2500 / 2JZGE 3000.&nbsp; With totally new bore / stroke configurations and 
further advanced thin wall casting and lightweight crankshafts- the long awaited 
“state-of-art” Toyota six cylinder Twin Cams finally arrived.&nbsp; Naturally the 
Turbo models1JZGTE / 2JZTGE supplemented the base models. As a tribute to Toyota 
engineers- the aftermarket reacted strongly and the performance envelope reached 
new heights- close to 800 HP capabilities on stock internals!</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:Arial">F Type High-Torque</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">The continuous development of the G Type 
Sport Twin Cam engines is complemented with applications for the more sedate 
sedans.&nbsp; A new Twin Cam design, F Type denoting “four valve” was introduced in 
1987.&nbsp; This replaced all the SOHC (single overhead cam) heads on the E, A, and S 
block engines.&nbsp; The F heads are “narrow” Twin Cams that provided improved 
performance to compensate for emission regulations; and were tuned specifically 
for quick RPM response / high torque.&nbsp; A notable exception is the 4EFTE engine- 
it is the only “sport” engine using an F-Type head.&nbsp; The E series replaced the K 
engines in the under 1500cc class for car appliocations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">All subsequent new Toyota engines:&nbsp; the NZ 
(under 1500cc), the RZ and TZ (above 2000cc) 4 cylinder engines; the MZ V6 and 
UZ V8, were all introduced with F Type Twin Cam heads and were subsequently 
upgraded to VVT specification.&nbsp; Most of the current Toyota engines use an F type 
cylinder head, enabling Toyota to continue the claim- world's leading supplier 
of the Twin Cam engine design. and the V6 and V8s.</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:Arial">Variable Timing +</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">In 1992, the 4AGE 1600 received VVT (Variable 
Cam Timing), individual throttle bodies, and an extra Valve &gt; 4AGE 20V! It 
produced 160 HP, the equivalent of 10 HP for every 100cc- racing engine output 
comparable to the early days of Twin Cams!&nbsp; By 1997, the JZ six cylinder models 
and the 3SGE Beams gained VVT heads too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">In it’s final reiteration the 3SGE gained 
Dual VVTi head and remains in production for the Altezza.&nbsp; The 3SGTE never had 
the VVTi head, but internal upgrades and different turbos allowed it to produce 
260 HP. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">The 2ZZGE 1800 is the newest and maybe LAST G 
series Twin Cam engine.&nbsp; The use of aluminum blocks is also a first for a Toyota 
performance engine.&nbsp; Up-graded features include variable timing and variable 
lift, and tuned intake manifold.</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:Arial">YAMAHA connection</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">The Yamaha connection needs to be mentioned: 
Yamaha developed the Toyota 2000GT and was a Toyota partner in the design of 
most Type G heads. Most engines/heads, including the 3SGE/3SGTE (now in it's 4th 
generation), the Previa specific 2TZFE/Z (no relation to the old T engines), and 
the newest 2ZZGE engines were and are still designed and cast by Yamaha.&nbsp; Yamaha 
also assembles most of the Toyota G model engines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">(The 4AGE and 2JZGE heads are proprietary 
Toyota designs and manufacture, although many components are still made and 
supplied by Yamaha). <br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Technology Driven</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">The classic Twin Cam design has worked very 
well for Toyota and has powered all milestone Toyota performance models. The 
current generation multi-valve / variable cam timing G Type Twin Cam 2JZGE, 
3SGE, 2ZZGE engines showcase the ultimate evolution of Toyota performance 
engines; and the F Type engines, for the rest of Toyota’s fleet, powers the 
Scion and Lexus models too. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:black">No other 
manufacturer can claim over-all superiority on production based Twin Cam 
engines. Although other manufacturers exploit the benefits of Twin Cam 
technology further, the </span><span style="font-family:
  Arial;color:black">Toyota</span><span style="font-family:Arial;color:black"> 
engine has proven more durable bar none. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:black">The Toyota Twin 
Cam engines has been produced in more variations: 1000cc to 5700cc; 2 or 4 or 5 
valves per cylinder; normally-aspirated, turbocharged, and supercharged. <br>
<br>
<b>Future Hybrid Twin </b></span><b>
<span style="font-family:Arial;
 color:black">Cam</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Toyota Twin Cam engines will remain in the 
forefront of Toyota technology.&nbsp; With all current </span>
<span style="font-family:
  Arial">Toyota</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> engines featuring Twin 
Cam head configurations of either Type F or G variety, it is assured that a 
Toyota Twin Cam will continue to power future Toyotas.&nbsp; The Prius 1NZFXE 1500cc 
proved Twin Cam compatibility for Hybrid applications.&nbsp; The new 3MZFE 3300cc has 
already been combined with Dual electric motors in engineering studies.&nbsp; 
“Electric Supercharger” is the operative term for the future.</span></p>
