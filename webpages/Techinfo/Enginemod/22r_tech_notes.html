<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><font size="2">The 20R 2200cc. 
  / 22R 2400cc. engines were the most popular US Toyota engines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>For 20 years, 1975 to 1995, these motors served as U.S.Toyota's dependable 
  workhorse engine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These engines 
  powered the popular Celicas until 1985, and the unbreakable Pick-up models used 
  these engines until 1995 (in commercial models).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span>Turbo models appeared briefly as the 22RTE in 1985-1988 on Pick-up and 
  4Runners.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 22RE Fuel injection 
  models appeared in 1983, on some Celica and Pick-up models.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>In 1985- the 22RE had a major change.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The block was taller and the head shorter, compared to the earlier models.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The engines' blocks and heads are not interchangeable (for practical 
  and cost purpose). <o:p> </o:p> </font> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><font size="2">The engines 
  are OHC design, with hemispherical combustion chambers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The cross-flow head was<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>very 
  efficient, short of a 2 or 4 valve (per cylinder) Twin Cam.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The long stroke provided a lot of torque at a reasonable RPM range.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The engine responded well to all the tuning tricks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The 20R head is different from the 22R heads.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The 20R had open combustion chambers and the 22R had a swirl-inducing 
  chamber (for cleaner emissions).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 
  intake ports on the 20R were round, and rectangular on the 22R.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Exhaust ports were identical round design.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The later 22RE (with the shorter deck height) had keyhole shaped exhaust 
  ports.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There were available 22RE 
  models that used the earlier 22R head, in the 1982 to 1984 Celica GTS.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>All 22RE from 1985 used the later blocks and heads. <o:p> </o:p> </font> 
  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><font size="2">The 22RTE 
  Turbo engine was based on the later model 22RE (short block /tall head).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>This is a similar but entirely different block and head.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The block was drilled with different oil passages to accommodate the 
  Turbo oil requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The cylinder 
  head's combustion chamber had a different shape.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The piston was dished.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Advertised 
  horsepower was 145.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The factory 
  set the boost at 5.5-6 pounds, but completely stock internals survived boosts 
  of up to 17-22 pounds, with proper fuel injection modifications.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>This is a testimony to the bulletproof bottom end design.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Nitro / Methanol fueled dragsters, producing in excess of 1100 HP- used 
  the original (modified) crankshafts and TOYSPORT pistons! <o:p> </o:p> </font> 
  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><font size="2">Toysport 
  built the first 2400 cc. 20R, these evolved in the 20/22R hybrid engines, in 
  the later years when the 22R engine was introduced in 1981.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The 20R head holds a distinct advantage over the 22R / RE heads, it flowed 
  better.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The availability of big 
  valves extended the tuning potential for the 20R (and all the other engines). 
  <o:p> </o:p> </font> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><font size="2">There was 
  a Japanese version 21R 2000cc, which had both an early and late model cylinder 
  head similar to the 20R and 22R.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These 
  were imported due to the big demand for used engines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>There is nothing of interest from these engines.<o:p> </o:p> </font> 
  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><font size="2">In 1985 Toysport 
  raced a 22RE Toyota Celica GTS in the Macao Grand Prix.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The original plan was to use an 18RG, but since the vehicle had US serial 
  #'s (from Toyota Motorsport) we were forced to use the U.S. engine the 22RE!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>To the entertainment of the other Toyota Teams from Japan, we qualified 
  at the last minute, in the last half of the grid.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The other Celicas (with their Twin Cams) were all in the top 6 positions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>At the finish the Toysport Celica placed 3<sup>rd</sup>- behind 2 BMW 
  Motorsport prepared 6 cylinder BMWs!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This 
  is the highest finish achieved by the 22RE in international racing competition.<o:p> 
  </o:p> </font> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><font size="2">From 1984 
  to 1989 Toysport prepared a Spec-Engine for SCORE / HDRA Toyota private entrants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The winnings from the Toyota Contingency Program testify to the racing 
  capability of the set-up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The engine 
  package kit is still available, as complete engines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>This set-up won National Championships for Toyota in Class 7 and Class 
  7 4WD.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The carbureted engines developed 
  185-195 HP, but consistently out ran the 239-240 HP Ford engines in the same 
  class.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The secret is in the torquey 
  characteristics of the power band.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 
  limiting factor of this engine is also its strongest point.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The long stroke limits RPM capability to about 6200 maximum, but the 
  bottom end will take a lot of abuse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 
  crankshaft is forged.<o:p> </o:p> </font> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2">Modifying 
  the 20R / 22R / 22RE / 22RTE Engines<o:p> </o:p> </font> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><font size="2">BLOCK:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The best set-up is achieved by starting with a 20R head and a 22R early 
  block.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This allows the use of the 
  twin-row timing chains- over the late model single-chain type.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Boring the 20R to 92mm is possible but some castings will develop bubbles 
  in the bores that eventually clean up at 92mm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The high compression pistons for the 20R / 22R are forged.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The stock early 22RE piston (full crown type) can also be used under 
  the 20R head but the block and deck must not have more than .5mm cut, if used 
  with big valves.<o:p> </o:p> </font> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><font size="2">The 20R / 
  22R early and 22RE late model, responds well to high compression pistons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The rods can be prepped by stress relieving and shot-peening.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The crankshaft oil galleys may be chamfered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>High Tensile bolts can be upgraded to ARP- main, rods, and head bolts 
  or stud kits.<o:p> </o:p> </font> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><font size="2">The early 
  and late style blocks have different engine mounting bosses, so interchangeability 
  of late block to early chassis and vice versa may come up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Some early and late blocks have provisions for both.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Really early and really late blocks do not have these provisions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>When preparing an engine, make sure that the block has the correct mounting 
  boss- or else you will have to deal with modifying them mounts.<o:p> </o:p> 
  </font> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><font size="2">The 22RTE 
  with forged pistons will survive 25 lbs!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>A metal head gasket is required.<o:p> </o:p> </font> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><font size="2">CYLINDER 
  HEAD:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is mandatory to port all 
  the heads.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Big valves are also 
  necessary to achieve and maximize the flow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Avoid cutting more than .50mm since valve clearance may be a problem 
  with some piston combinations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Tri-Y 
  headers work the best because they complement the wide torque band of these 
  engines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If you are converting 
  into the 20R head make sure that the 20R head has provisions for power steering 
  (if you have power steering).<o:p> </o:p> </font> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><font size="2">The choice 
  in camshafts from many sources, must be carefully considered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>High lift and long duration cams may affect the rocker arm geometry (and 
  oil spraying function of the oil feed).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Unless you take the time to ensure that the rocker arms are repositioned 
  correctly (modifying the rocker assembly) do not even attempt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The long stroke / low RPM design of the engine dictates very mild cam 
  lift and duration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You cannot redesign 
  an engine with camshafts!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span>Mild cams up to about 280 duration will work with the EFI with some adjustments 
  to the AFM (air flow meter).<o:p> </o:p> </font> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><font size="2">Stiffer valve 
  springs are a safeguard from valve-float, but will not enhance performance since 
  the best cam profiles will run fine with stock valve springs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>An adjustable camshaft gear will allow the most accurate setting (remember 
  that a Celica is totally different from a 4WD Pick-up).<o:p> </o:p> </font> 
  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><font size="2">There are 
  no TwinCam heads available for these engines.<o:p> </o:p> </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><font size="2">The 22RTE 
  head chambers can be opened to lower compression and increase the flow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Big valves should also be considered, but not obligatory since this is 
  forced induction.<o:p> </o:p> </font> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><font size="2">FUEL SYSTEM:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Twin side draft carburetors are a natural choice, but the EFI system 
  will work excellent if the vehicle is originally equipped with one. (Some manifolds 
  for the dual carbs have poorly designed water outlets that may cause overheating.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Long duration cams will seriously affect EFI engines, since combustion 
  pressure drop dramatically even with high compression pistons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>A fuel pressure adjuster may be needed. The Weber 32/36 or 38DPS are 
  good upgrades for single carb set-ups.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>For carburetors, use a low pressure, high volume fuel pumps.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Do not try to regulate lower fuel pressure with an adjuster because volume 
  will also decrease.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A fuel return 
  line is mandatory to allow the fuel pump and carburetor to function properly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>For any kind of performance do not rely on Toyota's mechanical or electric 
  pump, they do not have enough volume. The 22RTE with any upgrade will need a 
  higher output pump.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The fuel pressure 
  regulator should also be upgraded.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span><o:p> </o:p> </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><font size="2">TURBO UPGRADE:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The 22RTE needs forged pistons for any serious performance upgrade.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The CT26 Supra Turbo (not the MR2/AllTrac) can be installed with minor 
  fabrication.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With boost controller, 
  upgraded fuel delivery, 3&quot; exhaust system, and intercooler- the 22RTE will 
  put out in excess of 350HP, at about 25 psi!<o:p> </o:p> </font> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><font size="2">Normally 
  aspirated 20R / 22R engines can be turbocharged without too much problems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The stock pistons have to be replaced with low compression forged units.<o:p> 
  </o:p> </font> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">IGNITION 
  SYSTEM:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The basic ignition unit 
  was designed for low revving conditions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The electronics must be updated to the performance level intended for 
  the engines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>EFI engines converted 
  to carburetors must use carburetor style distributors.</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Ignition amplifiers and knock sensors must be used to avoid high RPM 
  misfires and detonation.<o:p> </o:p> </span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font size="2"><b>Some 
  Recommended Set-ups:<o:p> </o:p> </b></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">For 
  stock configuration-<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>the 20R / 
  22R / 22RE engines are very easy to work on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Due to different emission requirements for the different model years, 
  try to work on the original engine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Porting 
  the head will increase breathing and will not hurt emissions- so basically to 
  stay legal and improve performance- the cylinder head must be ported.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The early 22RE pistons can be used to upgrade the 20R to 2400cc.<o:p> 
  &nbsp;<o:p> </o:p> </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">For 
  modified configuration-<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>the 20R 
  head on top of early 22Rs will instantly give higher compression.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>All heads must be ported with big valves installed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Be careful of camshaft choice, just remember that all slow modified 20 
  / 22R / 22RE engines have been over-cammed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Do not try to install cams with duration over 280 on single carb or fuel 
  injection models.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Twin side carburetors 
  are the best way to go.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For limited 
  budget use the Weber 38 DPS.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Headers 
  installed with 2 3/4&quot; exhaust will be optimal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>A heavier flywheel will help 4WD models, that should also have the gear 
  ratios changed to compensate for tire sizes.<o:p> &nbsp;<o:p> </o:p> </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">For 
  racing configuration- basically these engines are truck engines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>For off-road truck racing and high performance street use (both pick-ups 
  and Celicas) the Toysport Spec SCORE / HDRA set-up is reliable and impressive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>See the parts list for the 20R / 22R engines.<o:p> </o:p> </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">Although 
  we have successfully used the 22RE in circuit racing and rallying, and truck 
  off-road racing- the only reason these engines were used was because of the 
  race regulations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The handicap 
  is the block configuration- which was built for torque and longevity- meaning 
  slow and heavy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The cylinder head 
  modifications, if properly done increases head flow by up to 200%.<o:p> </span>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">For 
  turbo set-up-<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>forged pistons, ported 
  head with open chambers, big valves, TO4 or CT26 turbo, 3&quot; exhaust, mild 
  cam, Carillo Rods, boost controller, blow-off valve and keep the boost under 
  25 psi!!</span><span style="font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"></span><b><span style="font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><o:p>
