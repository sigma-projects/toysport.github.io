<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><font face="Arial" size="2">The 
  4AG engines were introduced in 1984 as the replacement to the 2TG.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Although a lot of knowledgeable Toyota enthusiasts welcomed the 16 valve 
  head, many kept back their excitement because the engine looked fragile.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Internal pieces did not follow the usual Toyota robust design.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>In less time than the engines needed rebuilding, modified units were 
  performing and surviving in competition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Toyota has rewarded it's Twin Cam diehards- with a new engine!<o:p> 
</o:p> 
  &nbsp;<o:p> </o:p> </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><font face="Arial" size="2">The 
  secret in the 4AG's compact and lightweight design was better metallurgy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>This is how Toyota was able to guarantee 4AG durability equal to its 
  performance potential.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The iron 
  block was preferred over all-aluminum units, with a minimal weight disadvantage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The 4AG can be modified without the disastrous results of all-aluminum 
  blocks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For it's physical dimensions 
  Toyota was wise to keep the iron block.<o:p> </o:p> <o:p> </o:p> </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><font face="Arial" size="2">As 
  with any Toyota engine design- the 4AG evolved.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The first generation and second generation can be differentiated by their 
  large or small ports, and third generation with 5 valves!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The later versions had piston oil coolers, and higher compressions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The 4AG was very popular and during it's introduction and out ran any 
  4 cylinders 1600 with 16 valves.<o:p> </o:p> <o:p> </o:p> </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><font face="Arial" size="2">Toyota 
  Motorsports U.S.A. initiated a development program for these engines, and have 
  been rewarded with a successful Formula Atlantic series.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>These heavily modified engines maintained all the 4AG dimensions, with 
  modifications to the original block and cylinder heads.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>As a full racing engine the 4AG has proven itself.<o:p> </o:p> </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><font face="Arial" size="2">The 
  4AG originally powered 3 distinct drive arrangements- RWD (Corolla GTS), Mid-Ship 
  (MR2), and FWD (FX16).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There is 
  2 possible 4WD conversion available, but must only be used with stock HP output.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The later model Toyotas all went FWD, by which time the 4AG was in its 
  2<sup>nd</sup> generation (1990).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 
  4AG disappeared from the U.S. market by mid-91.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>By the 3<sup>rd</sup> generation, in Japan, the GTS 4A-GE and GTZ 4A-GZE 
  Supercharged engines were replaced by the 4AG 5 valve (1992).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The 5-valve has also a 2<sup>nd</sup> generation (1996).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The 4AG series evolved from 115HP to 170HP.<o:p> </o:p> </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><font face="Arial" size="2">The 
  4AG, because of its lightweight and compact design, is a very popular choice 
  for diverse applications.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Desert 
  racing buggies (qualifying for the Toyota Contingency program), Lotus 7 replicas, 
  and the older Toyota Corollas and Starlet all support the &quot;modern&quot; 
  4AG engines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Engine conversion 
  kits are available.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There is tremendous 
  respect for these power units, specially for RWD applications.<o:p> </o:p> </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><font face="Arial" size="2">In 
  Japan there is resurgent interest based on a comic hero, whose 4AG Corolla has 
  taken and beaten all comers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This 
  fantasy based on reality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Japanese 
  performance parts manufacturers, after discontinuing sports part production, 
  have again scheduled 4AG parts for production.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Just like the engine it replaced, the 2TG, the 4AG is the Toyota engine 
  for a whole new generation.<o:p> </o:p> </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><font face="Arial" size="2">The 
  U.S. 4AG-ZE in the MR2 developed 140HP with the supercharger and with strictly 
  bolt-on modifications produced 188HP.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>There was available a Twin Charger kit from HKS that developed 210HP 
  and after further modifications produced in excess of 350HP!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Also available was the HKS 5AG kit (not a Toyota designation), which 
  included a stroked crank and over-size pistons for 1720cc.<o:p> </o:p> </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><font face="Arial" size="2">We 
  have rallied the 4AG Corolla AE86 in many international FIA events.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The cars are very competitive in Group N. One of the first Corollas we 
  prepared was for SCCA GT 2, which ended up in South America.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>We have exported prepared 4AG engines to 5 countries!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>MR2s in SCCA IT (Improved Touring) are disadvantaged in the class, but 
  with a little tuning (late model blocks) become really competitive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>We have set-up both cars for SCCA Solo ! and II.<o:p> </o:p> </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><font face="Arial" size="2">The 
  fastest set-up is the Twin Charged MR2, and is completely streetable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Unfortunately the kit is no longer available. Turbo engines can be set-up 
  for ultimately more HP, but ac lot less tractable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The turbo engines, with forged or supercharger pistons, easily outrun 
  the 4AGZ, with the same psi output. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The 
  4AGZE engined MR2 and RWD/FWD Corolla conversions with the HKS (10 psi) big 
  pulley puts out at least 175 to 200.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There 
  are bigger pulley kits, example:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Cusco 
  (14 psi), that will definitely need additional EFI programming.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Mild cams and injectors can be combined for phenomenal cc. to HP output 
  ratios.<o:p> &nbsp; </font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000FF"><b><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="3">THE 
  4A-GE 20 VALVE</font></span></b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial" size="2">The 20-Valve 
  4AGE replaced the 4AGZE Supercharged engines. Just like the early and late 16 
  Valve 4Ges, they also underwent revisions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The Silver Top was introduced in the Corolla AE101 (1992), and the Black 
  Top in the Corolla AE111 (1997).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Both 
  engines used Toyota’s version of Variable cam timing- VVT.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Bore and stroke remained as in the original 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> 
  Generation 4AGEs (early) big port (TVIS) and (late) small port (non-TVIS).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Similarly compression was upped in the later models.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The blocks are identical to the late model AE92 generation blocks (and 
  naturally the SC blocks too). <o:p> </o:p> </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial" size="2">The 20-Valve 
  engines never came officially into the US (and many other foreign markets where 
  the old 4AGEs were available- and of course it imparts a very exotic presence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The individual throttle bodies look like they came off the fabulous 503 
  race engines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Think about 
  it, no Toyota factory RACE Engine had 5 valves per cylinder!!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Yamaha- who works with Toyota on cylinder head design (and manufacturing), 
  have been a very avid pioneer and supporter of the 5-valve design.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The short-lived Yamaha Formula 1 engines had 5 valves per cylinder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>In terms of maximum valve to surface area- the 5 valve design cannot 
  be beat- theoretically and geometrically.<o:p> </o:p> </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial" size="2">Aside from 
  the obvious 5-valve and variable timing cylinder head design- the difference 
  from the 4-valve is the dramatically reduced weight of the internal components.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Pistons, connecting rods, and to a lesser degree, crankshafts have all 
  been updated with lighter weight design.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The good news is that it remained an iron block- the engines were still 
  on solid foundation for heavy and serious modifications.<o:p> </o:p> </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial" size="2">Between the 
  Silver and Black top- the later Black models came with still lighter rotating 
  components.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Laying out the engine 
  components side by side…there are miniscule differences, Toyota was tuning the 
  engines to a higher degree by rotational mass reduction, a lesson advanced from 
  the earlier lightweight block design (of the pre-multi-valve engines).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span>The difference in the connecting rods between 16 and 20 valve engines 
  is dramatically surprising.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However 
  for purposes of radical modifications a Silver top will probably be a better 
  engine to work with (slightly stouter rod). <o:p> </o:p> </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial" size="2">In Japan these 
  engines were used in Formula Toyota, a series much like Formula Atlantic where 
  there is only one SPEC engine available to all competitors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The magic of 20-valve is apparent on the ability to attain and sustain 
  a high RPM threshold.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The addition 
  of variable cam timing allows the engine to surpass both low-end torque and 
  high RPM horsepower figures of the older 4AGEs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>This is the closest to race spec engine Toyota has ever produced.<o:p> 
  </o:p> </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial" size="2">In terms of 
  Toyota technology, the twin versions of the 20-valve engine- out specified any 
  previous offering in naturally aspirated form.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>This is the last true iron block with the ultimate head design and intake 
  set-up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The newer 1ZZFE and 2ZZGE 
  come with a more advance VVTi head set-up- but with 1 less valve (per cylinder) 
  and aluminum blocks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 4AG 20-Valve 
  wins!!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What will Toyota use for 
  the next Formula Atlantic engine??<o:p> </o:p></font></span></p>

  THE 4AG / 4AGZE</font><font color="#0000FF"><o:p> </font> </o:p> </b></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Block:</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Arial">&nbsp; 
  </span>The 4AG block is a free revving and strong bottom end.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Arial">&nbsp; 
  </span>A stock block will survive in excess of 350 HP if air-charged in the 
  8000 RPM range, or 250 HP in the 10000RPM range.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Arial">&nbsp; 
  </span>The 2<sup>nd</sup> generation blocks with oil squirters should be the 
  minimum considered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Arial">&nbsp; 
  </span>The connecting rods are also beefier, similar to the 4AGZ. The 1<sup>st</sup> 
  generation block had smaller wrist pins and rod journals, which should be fine 
  for milder tunes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Arial">&nbsp; 
  </span>For serious competition the rods should be replaced.<o:p> </o:p> </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><font face="Arial" size="2">Stroking 
  the crankshaft to a maximum 81mm will keep the RPM capability intact.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Bores can be brought out to 83mm, but try to keep it under 82.5mm. There 
  is no need for the Formula Atlantic crankshaft.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Reject blocks that will need 83mm to clean up, for sure there is head 
  damage also.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p> </o:p> </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><font face="Arial" size="2">Stay 
  away from the 7AF to 7AG conversion since the crank is not forged and the flywheel 
  bolts are too small, with no provision available to upgrade.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The rods are potential failures also when subjected to real 4AG RPM operation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>It is an exercise in creativity but a total sidestep for any real performance-oriented 
  application.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If you like the torque 
  of the 7AF, use the complete engine.<o:p> </o:p> </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Cylinder 
  Head:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Arial">&nbsp; </span>There 
  are some issues about the Formula Atlantic head.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Arial">&nbsp; 
  </span>The Formula Atlantic head is a modified 4AG head- port and polished with 
  the valve adjusters changed to the under-the-bucket shim arrangement (similar 
  to the 2TG and 18RG).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Arial">&nbsp; 
  </span>The valves and springs are different too. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span>This 
  modification is required when running camshafts with high lift and/or long duration 
  (above 300).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Arial">&nbsp; </span>For 
  street purposes there is no advantage converting to this adjustment method or 
  preparing the head to Atlantic specifications.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Arial">&nbsp; 
  </span>The port and chamber modifications will decrease performance- short of 
  preparing the complete engine to Formula Atlantic specifications, which will 
  render the package totally unstreetable.<o:p> </o:p> </span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><font face="Arial" size="2">There 
  is very minimal head preparation needed, aside from match porting and polishing 
  the runners.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Porting the heads 
  on this 16 valve Twin Cam more often decreases the air velocity- resulting in 
  poorer throttle response.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Despite 
  others claim of a 20HP or more increase- on modified heads alone, this is simply 
  impossible without camshaft or pistons changed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Toyota has casted and machined all their 4 valve heads to very close 
  and accurate tolerances for street (and rally) use.<o:p> </o:p> </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><font face="Arial" size="2">Camshaft 
  choices for stock EFI systems and pistons should be limited to less than 265 
  duration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Upgraded blocks with 
  pistons of at least 10.5:1 compression may use up to 288.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>It is recommended to convert to under-the-bucket shims for durations 
  over 300 (with corresponding higher compression pistons).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Installing high duration cams on the stock set-up will cause the shims 
  to fall-off and instant result in instant engine seizure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>As always stay away from reground cams with non-factory lobe centers, 
  you will have problems getting the correct adjustment shims.<o:p> </o:p> </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><font face="Arial" size="2">On 
  the 4AGZ intake manifold- the #1 runner, which is dog-legged, must be filled 
  and recontoured.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is a simple 
  procedure that must be done.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Be 
  sure to frequently check the supercharger oil also.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Many units have died because of oil starvation.<o:p> </o:p> </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><font face="Arial" size="2">The 
  5 valve head is Toyota's bonus to the 4AG after the 4AGZE went away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>With the additional valve and independent throttle bodies- the 4AG 20 
  valve is a unique head design.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This 
  head unfortunately has many proprietary pieces and the only way to do a conversion 
  to a 5 valve is only with a complete engine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The distributor position may be a problem in RWD installations. (Note: 
  There are 2 versions of the 5-valve engine, see related information under Japanese 
  engines).<o:p> </o:p> </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Supercharger 
  / Turbo Upgrade-<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Arial">&nbsp; </span>The 
  preparation for the turbo set-up is to lower the compression.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Arial">&nbsp; 
  </span>The 4AG / 4AGZ that will see boosts in excess of 10 psi should be set-up 
  with forged pistons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Arial">&nbsp; 
  </span>Blocks with the oil squirters must be used as these come with the better 
  rods.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Arial">&nbsp; </span>For boosts 
  higher than 18 psi, the rods have to be replaced.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Arial">&nbsp; 
  </span>Oil cooler is mandatory, and for all applications a bigger radiator is 
  a good investment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Arial">&nbsp; 
  </span>Use the 4AGZ injectors and fuel pressure regulator for turbo conversions 
  of the normally aspirated 4AG.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Arial">&nbsp; 
  </span>550cc injectors are available for serious boost / engine outputs. The 
  fuel pump can be replaced with the Supra Turbo pump, a direct bolt-in.<o:p> 
  </o:p> </span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Fuel 
  System-<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Arial">&nbsp; </span>If 
  at all possible avoid using the dual side-draft carbs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Arial">&nbsp; 
  </span>The cost for the carbs / manifold plus ignition conversion will come 
  close to a new fuel injection system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Arial">&nbsp; 
  </span>The EFI system will be adequate for minor tuning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Arial">&nbsp; 
  </span>4AG/Z EFI systems use either an AFM (air flow meter) or MAP (manifold 
  air pressure).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Arial">&nbsp; </span>The 
  AFM model is actually preferred since it will allow the user some adjustability 
  for modified cams; there is no compensation available with MAP sensors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Arial">&nbsp; 
  </span>There is no advantage to converting to a MAP sensor, the idea of loss 
  HP due to the AFM restriction is not true. <o:p> </o:p> </span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Ignition 
  System:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Arial">&nbsp; </span>Even 
  4AGZs equipped with DFI (direct fire ignition), will see a performance increase 
  with an ignition amplifier.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Arial">&nbsp; 
  </span>This is one of very few Toyota ignitions that are marginal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Arial">&nbsp; 
  </span>Colder plugs must be used with any upgrade.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Arial">&nbsp; 
  </span>For carburetor equipped 4AGs the distributor has to supplemented with 
  a timing controller, MSD 6A, and a coil.<o:p> </o:p></span></font></span></p>

  </span>Depending on the EFI system used, choose the mildest cam available- you 
  will have better results. Adjustable cam pulleys will ensure accurate timing 
  and cylinder pressure tuning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Arial">&nbsp; 
  </span>Forged high compression pistons are reasonably priced and are a good 
  upgrade.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Arial">&nbsp; </span>Modifying 
  to a late model head will require fabrication of a new intake layout for RWD.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Arial">&nbsp; 
  </span>The throttle body can also be enlarged to maximize air intake.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><font face="Arial" size="2">The 
  4AGZE conversion for normally aspirated models will need the correct power steering 
  pump, air conditioning compressor, and alternator.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>This pieces are unique to this application- and the proper bracket is 
  also a must.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The top mounted intercooler 
  will fit under the normally aspirated MR2 hood and will need a hood scoop on 
  FWD Corollas (but a front mount intercooler is still the best set-up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The bigger (14 psi) crank pulley is a must. <o:p> </o:p> </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><font face="Arial" size="2">There 
  are as many tuning theories as there are tuning shops.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The most important step in preparing an engine is to finalize the exact 
  set-up before buying any part.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Displacement 
  increase that does not affect the bore / stroke ratio, to the detriment of RPM 
  potential will give the engine the edge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The stock 16 valve head has undergone a lot of development time in terms 
  of cam configuration- unlike a displacement increase (done properly), a wrong 
  camshaft choice will result in a completely unsatisfactory set-up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

  Racing configuration-<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Arial">&nbsp; 
  </span>The preparation of any engine in sanctioned Motorsport events are tightly 
  regulated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Arial">&nbsp; </span>Know 
  the rules before starting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Arial">&nbsp; 
  </span>FIA Group A or N parts homologated for use in these engines are available.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Arial">&nbsp; 
  </span>Any serious preparation will start by converting the valve adjustment 
  to the racing type (TRD) under-the bucket shims.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;

  </span>Formula Atlantic spec con-rods may be used with the correct piston (19mm).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Arial">&nbsp; 
  </span>For supercharged or turbo applications stay with the 20mm pins.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Arial">&nbsp; 
  </span>Lightened flywheels are available, to ensure the fastest throttle response.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Arial">&nbsp; 
  </span>Cylinder port and chamber configuration approaching Formula Atlantic 
  specs can be used- but never the full Atlantic spec if the engine is not going 
  into a formula chassis or dune buggy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;
