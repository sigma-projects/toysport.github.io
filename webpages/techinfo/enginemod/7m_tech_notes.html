<hr color="#3333FF" style="background-color: #0080FF" size="3">
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The 7 Series M engine was the last of the M blocks. 
  The evolution from a 2000cc SOHC in-line 6 cylinder to a 3000cc DOHC 24 valve 
  saw this engine family powering Toyota’s top of the line cars for over 30 years. 
  Before retiring this series block Toyota saw it fit to crown the block with 
  an impressive 24 valve head.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Following Toyota’s pattern of evolutionary engine 
  development, the 7MG was a trouble free design- except for the cylinder head 
  gasket problem. In both turbo and non-turbo varieties, the gaskets tend to start 
  failing as early as 80,000. It does not matter wether the cars were either driven 
  extremely hard or easy. Maximum mileage is from normally used engines, some 
  of which survived to 150,000!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The bottom line is that these engines can survive 
  all the horsepower you set it up for as long as you are aware of the maintenance 
  requirement it needs (head gasket). Keep a fresh gasket on hand and it is capable 
  of producing a lot of power.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The later model engines came with the Lexus style 
  oil-filled mounts. The slight horsepower increase in the latter models came 
  from computer tuning and exhaust differences. Internally they are identical.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In competition the 7MGT was handicapped by the 
  heavy Supra body. Although it won numerous races- there was no major titles 
  for this engine. Thanks to Japanese tuners (HKS, Greddy, Blitz) the street Toyota 
  denizens ruled over the competitive models from other manufacturers. In it’s 
  class and generation the 7MG was the engine. This same power potential led us 
  to power older Supras, RWD Celicas, some pick-ups, even a cigarette boat- with 
  these engines.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000FF">Modifying the 7MG / 7MGTE:</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">BLOCK: </font></b><font face="Arial" size="2">The 
  block is trouble-free, but will not tolerate low oil conditions. It is a very 
  robust bottom end that will survive mega horsepower engine build-ups. Since 
  it is a long crankshaft, crack testing is mandatory between rebuilds. The con-rod 
  small end should also be rebushed because they are subject to a lot of stress. 
  Maximum bore should be limited to 85.5mm.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">For normally aspirated engines compression can 
  be raised to a maximum 12.5 compression, after which the dome design starts 
  interfering with the combustion air-flow. For turbo set-up the compression can 
  be set as low as 8.0:1. The original pistons did not benefit from later Toyota 
  practice of piston coating, so for any major projects forged pistons are the 
  only ticket.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Although the engine is able to rev high and the 
  bottom end will survive high RPMs, heavy continuous boost conditions past 16psi 
  will eventually warp the heads. Judicious use of boosts up to 30psi is not uncommon 
  and survivable.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The block decks should be resurfaced to the best 
  finish available. Invariably the head gasket will have gouged the surface. Make 
  sure that the aluminum timing cover is on the block when the deck is surfaced, 
  or else the head gasket will not seal properly. We send the blocks and head 
  to a special grinding outfit- that machines aircraft components, and they are 
  able to surface to a mirror finish. Upgrade all the engine assembly bolts. Replace 
  all the hoses. Keep a spare head gasket.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">CYLINDER HEAD: </font></b><font face="Arial" size="2">The 
  24 valve head is trouble free, but should be checked for warpage. There is a 
  common propensity for the aluminum head to deteriorate around the water passages. 
  Use the best anti-freeze you can get- more heads become unusable because of 
  material erosion and decomposition- rather than cracking or warpage. The intake 
  and exhaust ports can be cleaned up, but port and polishing is not mandatory- 
  there are other pieces you can spend on that will return more horsepower for 
  the budget.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Camshafts and adjustable gears are available to 
  maximize the full potential of these 24 valve heads. Do not use cams over 280 
  degrees since the lower cylinder pressure will cause erratic inputs to the ECU. 
  On the turbo models, the use of NA cams is an easy upgrade, if you can find 
  them. In the cam journals to the head, there is a soft leadlike coating that 
  is normally scoured. We have successfully polished of all coating into the bare 
  journal and reused the cams with no problems.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The valve seals on some engines harden abnormally 
  soon, sometimes even before the head gasket bows out. Replace the valve seals 
  when you do a head gasket replacement. Again surfacing (like the block) to the 
  best finish is mandatory. Use an aftermarket metal headgasket for maximum mileage 
  in between teardowns.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">FUEL SYSTEM: </font></b><font face="Arial" size="2">The 
  stock fuel system for the NA and turbo models is adequate. For heavy turbo modifications 
  please read the next section. The VPC designed for the 7MGT can also be used 
  on the NA, an exclusive Toysport modification. This eliminates the air-flow 
  meter and does wonders for throttle response and boost transition. For additional 
  capacity there are 550cc injectors that will drop-in; use a JZA80 (Twin Turbo) 
  fuel pump that is a direct replacement.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">TURBO UPGRADE: </font></b><font face="Arial" size="2">The 
  factory turbo is able to run boosts up to 14 psi (1 bar). Trying to boost above 
  this is plain useless. In order of importance- the exhaust, intercooler, boost 
  controller, ignition, fuel computer, turbo, vein pressure converter, injectors 
  are the steps in upgrading. For anything over 14 psi a new block with forged 
  pistons is necessary. Adjusting compression ratio for a non-turbo being upgraded 
  to turbo, by the head gasket is not recommended.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The availability of metal head gaskets in various 
  thickness and composition is more to compensate for the milling of the head 
  and block, and slight adjustments in compression. There are 3 types of aftermarket 
  metal headgaskets available- Stopper, Bead, and Grommet. The Stopper is a multi-layer 
  set-up that will survive better than a factory gasket. The Bead has also multi-layer 
  and is a more flexible and has a raised bead to help seal around the pistons. 
  The Grommet has an additional seal ring, (like the factory units) and will take 
  the most abuse.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The most usable turbo upgrade is based on the CT26 
  stock turbo. We were the first company to do this and maintain proprietary specifications. 
  Some companies also do upgrades, but we are certain our set-up is the best. 
  A twin turbo set-up is available, that makes the engine dramatically responsive 
  and powerful- this is based on HKS TwinTurbo set-up on the old 5MG. There are 
  numerous other single turbo set-ups, but they are not streetable.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">IGNITION SYSTEM: </font></b><font face="Arial" size="2">The 
  simplest most effective ignition upgrade for either NA or Turbo, are the HKS 
  Twin Power (there are two different units). Do not even think of something else. 
  The MSD or NGK wires also work very well as upgrades to factory wires.</font></p>
<font face="Arial">
<p><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#0000FF"><b>Some Recommended Set-ups:</b></font></p>
</font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">For stock configuration: The 7MGE/TE are common 
  engines that reputable import shops, should be able to service. Machining engine 
  components should be only trusted to known machine shops, since tolerance limits 
  are crucial and very specific. Domestic machine shops, used to Detroit specifications, 
  will not be able to properly service the requirements. There are several good 
  overhauling gasket sets aside from factory- which are equal to the factory issue, 
  but as a minimum use only factory original headgasket. Replacing the exhaust 
  (on both models) produce instant power, the factory units &quot;crimp&quot; 
  right under the axles- which the aftermarket units are able to maintain the 
  full diameter.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">For modified configuration: For normally aspirated 
  models, mild cams, headers and a good exhaust produce expected results. To build 
  a high compression model, stay within 12.5:1 compression (but you may need octane 
  booster on really hot days. Do not expect to reach turbo power levels. For turbo 
  models, re-read the Turbo Upgrade section. There were a lot of magazines that 
  covered different set-ups- read between the lines. You will find that some articles 
  contradict other articles! Enough said.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">For racing configuration: Use the older Supra body, 
  or remove everything bolted inside the car. More seriously- the engine is capable 
  but the weight penalty does not make this vehicle competitive in all out racing. 
  For milder competition like, Club Rallying or Road Racing- a properly set-up 
  Turbo will be close to unbeatable, plus you will be cruising comfortably too.</font></p>
