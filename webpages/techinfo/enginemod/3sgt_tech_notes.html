<p><b><span style="font-size: 16.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: blue">3SGE / 
3SGTE ENGINE SWAP</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial"><font face="Arial" size="2">The 3SGE and 3SGTE are important engines in 
the Toyota line-up.&nbsp; They are the most potent of all the Toyota 4 cylinder 
engines in the 2000cc class.&nbsp; Celica, Camry, MR2, RAV4, and Corolla owners can 
benefit by upgrading to this engine.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial"><font face="Arial" size="2">For Celicas, Camrys, MR2s, and RAV4s- 
equipped with the 3S, 3SFE, 5SFE- engines the natural upgrade is the 3SGTE with 
horsepower ranging from 200 to 260 HP in the different generations.&nbsp; With minor 
bolt-on upgrades power up to 350 is attainable.&nbsp; Internally-built engines can 
produce up to 400 safely.&nbsp; The standard transmissions can be used quite 
effectively, but if you are planning running 12+ psi boost get the Turbo 
transmission.. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial"><font face="Arial" size="2">For a milder set-ups the 3SGE may be 
adequate.&nbsp; Naturally aspirated the 3SGE is available from 140 to 200 HP.&nbsp; The 2<sup>nd</sup> 
generation (never imported to the US) produces 170 HP and are relatively cheap.&nbsp; 
Most parts for these engines are interchangeable with US engines, and is 
therefore easier to get parts for.&nbsp; The 3<sup>rd</sup> generation has 180 HP, 
and we support the unique parts for this engine.&nbsp; The 4<sup>th</sup> generation 
with VVTi has 200 HP, but is expensive and difficult to wire.</font> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial"><font face="Arial" size="2">With such a wide choice of applicable 
engines, it is more the budget rather than HP availability that will determine 
your choice.&nbsp; Converting engines will require changing harness, ECU, AFM, 
related relays and igniters.&nbsp; No these are not legal in the US, unless you use 
US model engines (which limit you to the 1<sup>st</sup> generation 3SGE and 
3SGTE, from the Celicas AllTracs, or the 2<sup>nd</sup> generation 3SGTE in the 
MR2s and AllTracs..</font> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial"><font face="Arial" size="2">Japanese imported engines do not have EGRs- 
an important smog device required in US engines.&nbsp; It is impossible to modify a 
non-EGR head.&nbsp; Emission controls in Japan are stricter than the US, so 
technically they will pass tail-pipe emission tests, but they will fail any 
visual smog inspection.</font> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial"><font face="Arial" size="2">Celica Notes:&nbsp; Any S engined Celica is 
relatively easy to do, if you have all the correct parts.&nbsp; Celicas with the A 
engines will require a new transmission, new engine brackets and new power 
steering and ac lines. For turbo, read the following MR2 notes.&nbsp; Stick with the 
2<sup>nd</sup> generation engines as it has a built-in air-to-air intercooler.&nbsp; 
The 3<sup>rd</sup> generation engines have Liquid-to-Air intercooler and trying 
to set it up, you basically need a front clip.</font> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial"><font face="Arial" size="2">MR2 Notes:&nbsp; Turbo conversions are best done 
using the 3SGTE, rather than turbo kits.&nbsp; 3SGTEs drop in easily with minor 
rewiring and the usual new resistors, igniters, and relays.&nbsp; You need the 
correct engine harness, ECU, and AFM.&nbsp; We normally stock complete conversion 
kits.&nbsp; Changing transmissions is not critical, but if you plan very heavy use go 
get the turbo transmission.&nbsp; This will require new axles, depending on the year 
model of the transmission, ABS, LSD, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; The any generation 3SGE is a good 
substitute to the 5SFE, in fact in Japan it is the standard engine.&nbsp; For the 
ultimate- drop a 3SGTE in an AW11!</font> </span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family: Arial"><font face="Arial" size="2">UPDATE:&nbsp; 3SGE and 3SGE installations for 
the AW11 is now a lot easier.&nbsp; Previously, we had to modify firewalls, brackets, 
etc.&nbsp; We have brackets and engine accessories that will make this all simple- 
with AC too !!!.&nbsp; Watch updates under Project Cars.</font></span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial"><font face="Arial" size="2">Corolla Notes:&nbsp; The 3SGE and 3SGTE engines 
have been installed in the FWD and RWD Corolla models.&nbsp; In RWD configuration, 
new intake and exhaust manifolds need to be fabricated or the original units 
reoriented, since these engines were originally designed and installed at an 
angle.&nbsp; See our list of RWD conversion parts- NOTE this is to fit the 3SGE or 
3SGTE into a RWD chassis, not to convert cars to RWD.&nbsp; The only exception is the 
Altezza 3SGE Dual VVTi that came in RWD form only!&nbsp; In FWD, new brackets for the 
engine and transmission need to be fabricated.</font> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial"><font face="Arial" size="2">These are general guidelines.&nbsp; We have no 
step-by-step instructions to do these conversions, since there are a lot of 
variables involved.&nbsp; Do not attempt if you are doing this conversion by yourself 
and feel you are not up to the task or your shop has never done one before.&nbsp; See 
the 3SGE / 3SGTE TECH NOTES also.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
