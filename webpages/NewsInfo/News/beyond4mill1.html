<span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Arial">Yoshio Ishizaka, 
Executive Vice President Toyota Motor Corporation, talks about the automaker's 
&quot;Beyond 4 Million&quot; sales campaign, a company-wide, planet-wide effort to gain a 
foothold toward further sales growth.</span></font></span></p>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black; font-family: Arial">Carving out a 
foothold for long-range overseas sales expansion</span></font></b></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<font face="Arial" color="black" size="3" style="line-height: 1.3em">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black">In 2002, we sold 3.84 million Toyota 
& Lexus brand vehicles in overseas markets, surpassing our 2001 figure of 3.55 
million and setting a new record for the 11th straight year. This was made 
possible by global teamwork, both within Toyota and with our partners. <br>
In North America we achieved 1.94 million sales, within sight of the 2-million 
unit mark, which we aim to pass soon. Asia's stabilizing economies give us high 
hopes for the region. In Europe, popularity of our new Corolla, Yaris and RAV4 
have driven sales up to nearly 760,000, well on the way to our 2005 target of 
800,000, a five percent market share.</span></font></p>

<span style="font-size: 12pt">Three keys to popularity</span></font></b></h2>
<p class="MsoBodyText2">
<font face="Arial" color="black" size="3" style="line-height: 1.3em">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black; font-family: Arial">But to achieve 
sales volume with profitability we need to make sure our customers prefer our 
products. There are three important ways we can support Toyota's popularity.<br>
<br>
First, we must generate and communicate the excitement and vision of our brand. 
Our participation in F1 racing has helped immensely, particularly in Europe 
where brand recognition has risen significantly. <br>
<br>
Second, we can be bolder and more self-assured in accelerating our environmental 
initiatives, building on the positive public reception and confidence gained 
through the success of our hybrid technologies so far.<br>
<br>
Third, we must come through with the products people around the world are 
seeking to match their lifestyles and life stages. As a global player, Toyota 
must make sure the breadth of its auto engineering expertise continues to be 
matched by a corporate culture thoroughly versed in the &quot;Toyota Way.&quot; We want 
every Toyota & Lexus owner to become a lifetime advocate.</span></font></p>

<span style="font-size: 12pt">How to go &quot;Beyond 4 Million&quot;</span></font></b></h2>
<p class="MsoBodyText3">
<font face="Arial" color="black" size="3" style="line-height: 1.3em">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial">In 2003 we want to go &quot;beyond 
4 million&quot; and achieve our 12th consecutive year of record overseas sales. This 
will be a foothold for the climb toward longer-range growth. One of our primary 
thrusts is to broaden Toyota's appeal, as we are doing in North America with our 
Scion marketing group, which has introduced vehicles fashioned for a younger age 
bracket. In turn, we are taking our luxury marque, the Lexus, beyond North 
America, and developing it into a global brand. That includes Japan, where Lexus 
will make its debut in 2005. Our hopes also continue to rise for China, India 
and other emerging markets. I think the time for hesitation is past. We can move 
forward now confidently, a step at a time, to greater sales growth &quot;beyond 4 
million.&quot; Around the globe, Toyota team members are striving to make this dream 
come true.</span></font></p>
