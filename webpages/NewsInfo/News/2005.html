<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue">2005.</span></b><span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp; 
The Celica and MRS /MR2 bow out.&nbsp; The Supra moved on 5 years ago with the Levin 
and Trueno.&nbsp; The AllTrac and GT4 Celica disappeared 6 years ago.&nbsp; Even in Japan, 
there are no more sporty Toyotas.&nbsp; All followed the Toyota 2000GT- gone to 
Toyota’s great museum in the sky, a couple left parked in our garage.&nbsp; Cherished 
orphaned nameplates now.&nbsp; Abandoned, decommissioned, discontinued, and seemingly 
given an unappreciated exit.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">The 4AGE and 3SGE had been 
retired.&nbsp; The 3SGTE is hiding in some non-sporting Toyota.&nbsp; The 2JZGTE is soon 
to follow all the other great legendary Toyota Twin Cams of the performance 
variety: 3M, 9R, 2TG, 3TGTE, 18RG, and 7MGTE.&nbsp; This has got to be the lowest 
point in Toyota product and engine line-up for the Toyota enthusiast.&nbsp; The 2ZZGE 
is hiding under some hoods.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">And you, we, all of us <u>
supposed</u> Toyota enthusiasts and racers are to blame.&nbsp; The Toyota performance 
cars did not sell in the #s Toyota needed.&nbsp; Simply put, Toyota does not need our 
business or opinion.&nbsp; So do not bother calling Toyota and registering your grief 
or indignation, there were not enough of us to support and buy the performance 
products. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Toyota Marketing trounced 
Toyota Engineering and Product Planning.&nbsp; They will show you charts, 
projections, studies, trends, and 1000’s of reasons to shut you up.&nbsp; Do not 
despair there are still some enthusiasts in Product Planning, but It is a pure 
money issue.&nbsp; We could only wish that Toyota Marketing appreciated the legacy of 
the sporty Toyotas as much as the now disenfranchised Toyota enthusiasts still 
do.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">The Toyota future looks 
pure Prius, SUV, and Scion. Hopefully you are brushed up with RC car technology, 
have 7 friends to drive around, and not adverse to flash marketing and fashion 
fads.&nbsp; Or inane limited editions or numbered series.&nbsp; Decals, emblems, and paint 
jobs do not make a car special- performance engines do.&nbsp; If you look hard 
enough, 2ZZGE engines still lurk under some hoods in generic sedan bodies. A 
candle in the darkness in the middle of a storm.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Eventually Toyota will be # 
1 in the world.&nbsp; The Camry Hybrid and Lexus line will continue to high profile 
as the quintessential Toyota products.&nbsp; Toyota trucks will rule Texas.&nbsp; Toyota 
will continue posting yearly RECORD SALES.&nbsp; Toyota tried to emulate Chrysler and 
became even better than it.&nbsp; Toyota’s Global 10 became Global 15- the corporate 
goal to capture the market share percentage. Not the Toyota we loved.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Toyota will continue racing 
IRL, NASCAR, and F1.&nbsp; Maybe even dominate, as it has done before to promote the 
then current Twin Cams.&nbsp; The better to impress people who never experienced the 
joy of a TE27 with a 2TG, RA20 with an 18RG, AE86 with a 4AGE, ST205 and SW20 
with a 3SGTE, JZA80 with the 2JZGTE.&nbsp; But who is the target market for all this 
motor sport greatness?&nbsp; Win on Sunday, mass transit on Monday?&nbsp; At least the 
Toyota Factory teams have fun.&nbsp; Paid for by the boring cars.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">For Toyota enthusiasts, 
life is not fair.&nbsp; Probably, we did not make enough money to afford the ……&nbsp; And 
market dominance screws up corporate values.&nbsp; Money talks and enthusiasts walk.&nbsp; 
Toyota has showed their real spirit, cannot call it soul: it has become an 
unexciting but efficient automobile manufacturer, dependably boring, hugely 
profitable.&nbsp; Performance glorified in marketing, not under the hood.&nbsp; In the 
current season of factory 500HP luxury cars and SUVs, the high revving multi-valved 
supercharged turbocharged Toyota Twin Cam engines did not matter.&nbsp; The 
Nameplates that made Toyota famous and legendary (and the envy of other 
manufacturers) in the different international / local racing circuits and in the 
import show / street scene have run out of Toyota Corporate supporters.&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Even TRD in Japan and the 
U.S., with all their good intentions will be hard pressed to change the new 
Toyota image, so do not blame them too- their jobs maybe next.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">1985 to 2005.&nbsp; Twenty years 
of radical change in Toyota.&nbsp; For the Toyota enthusiasts, twenty years from the 
top to the buttom.&nbsp; The cars we love have become clichés. The Supras, Celicas, 
MR2s, Levins and Truenos ….. will all become “old School”.&nbsp; A tunnel with no 
light at the end…..&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">2025. Who knows? Or do we 
even care?</span></p>
