<h2><span style="font-size: 16.0pt; color: blue">NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE</span></h2>
<p class="MsoBodyText3"><font face="Arial">1985.&nbsp; Toyota could not do anything 
wrong.&nbsp; In the important U.S. market the product line was solid.&nbsp; Product for 
product, Toyota models bested offerings from other car manufacturers.&nbsp; Car of 
the Year Awards all over the place.&nbsp; The Corolla GTS, MR2, Celica GTS, and 
Supra- the Toyota enthusiasts were well served.&nbsp; Toyota USA President, Mr. Togo, 
set personal goals for the U.S. company, and he achieved them all- Motorsports, 
Manufacturing, Exporting, Mini-Trucks, even Aviation !</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:black">On a visit to 
Japan, we learned about Toyota Global Ten:&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Arial;
  color:black">Toyota</span><span style="font-family:
Arial;color:black">’s corporate goal for 10% of the world automotive market.</span><font face="Arial"><span style="color:black">
</span></font><span style="font-family:Arial;color:black">&nbsp;In Japan, Toyota 
owned the industry.&nbsp;&nbsp; Aggressive expansion in Europe had begun and Toyota was on 
a fast learning curve.&nbsp; The Corolla was the best selling car in the world.&nbsp; The 
Camry was being Americanized.&nbsp; And the enthusiasts had their choice</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="color:black">By 1990, a 
new decade,&nbsp; Toyota was still on top, with a brand new division Lexus.. Toyota 
products were world-class products.&nbsp; Toyota sporty cars had the best engines in 
their class.&nbsp; </span><span style="color: black">Industry insiders and Trade 
magazines who predicted that Honda will surpass Toyota were proved wrong- if you 
added the Toyota truck and van sales.&nbsp; Honda was on track to capture the 
entry-level market.&nbsp; (Even Acura had an entry-level model, a Twin Cam.)&nbsp; Toyota 
had all it’s bases covered:&nbsp; Luxury, Sporty, Van, and Trucks. </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Toyota , however, started 
to loose a generation of die-hards interested in performance cars and 
interesting entry-level cars.&nbsp; Cars that performed the best in their class.&nbsp; 
Cars with state-of-the art engines.&nbsp; Cars you are proud to drive.&nbsp; Cars you can 
have fun with. And can ultimately afford.&nbsp; </span></p>
<h3>NINETEEN NINETY FIVE</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:black">1995.&nbsp;&nbsp; Toyota 
remained on top of the Import market, with the Camry, SUV, and truck sales.&nbsp; In 
five years, Lexus became an award-laden and established Luxury brand.&nbsp; Even 
mighty Mercedes, the historic and iconoclastic purveyor of benchmark automobiles 
was forced to reposition and reinvent their stars.&nbsp; To achieve yearly Sales 
Records and Profits, </span><span style="font-family:
  Arial;color:black">Toyota</span><span style="font-family:Arial;color:black"> 
concentrated on improving the Camry and trucks, gaining on new markets and 
keeping millions of loyal customers.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:black">Toyota 
Motorsports&nbsp; in the U.S. had won numerous Championships, making Toyota 
enthusiasts real proud.&nbsp; Even Toyota USA , caught in the excitement continued 
buying out TRD Japan’s interests in TRD USA- the better to serve the U.S, 
market. The Supra and MR2 Turbo gained cult-like status, making Toyota 
enthusiasts even prouder.&nbsp; You almost did not miss the disappearance of the real 
GTS Corolla and Celica models.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:black">A Japan visit 
was dismal.&nbsp; Japan was in Recession.&nbsp; At that time, Nissan and Mazda were at the 
brink of collapse, which would have caused Japanese and World recession. The 
Japanese Trade ministry “advised” Toyota about market expansion. This resulted 
in Toyota trying to maximize profit on model lines and unit sales, not market 
share.&nbsp; There was less emphasis on entry-level, low margin vehicles.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font face="Arial"><span style="color: black">As Lexus 
continued making history in the Luxury field, Honda had entrenched and owned the 
entry-level and aftermarket.&nbsp; Even the U.S. Honda Twin Cam engines were better 
than U.S. Toyota’s!&nbsp; Toysport had to import the real Toyota Twin Cams from Japan 
(just like in the 80”s) to keep parity in the streets.&nbsp; U.S. magazine surveys 
showed the different Toyota car models became also-rans in their test / review 
categories.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font face="Arial"><span style="color:black">Toyota 
Corporate in Japan and the U.S. realized the situation and the Genesis Group was 
formed.&nbsp; Record sales and profits in Toyota, overshadowed the gradual 
disappearance of interesting Toyota niche models.&nbsp; </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:black">In 2000, the 
new millennium, </span><span style="font-family:Arial;
  color:black">Toyota</span><span style="font-family:
Arial;color:black">’s product line-up has lost favor with the performance 
enthusiast core.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Turbo and GTS models were gone.&nbsp; Toyota SUV’s RAV4, 
Highlander, 4Runner, Sequoia, and Land Cruiser represented </span>
<span style="font-family:Arial;color:black">Toyota’s commitment to the emerging 
market.&nbsp; The entry-level products were dismal and demanding attention.&nbsp; It would 
take a major impetus from </span>
<span style="font-family:
  Arial;color:black">Toyota</span><span style="font-family:Arial;color:black"> 
to recapture the Sporty and entry-level market.</span></p>
