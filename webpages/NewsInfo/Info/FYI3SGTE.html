<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Arial">What turbo CT26? / 
CT20? / 20B ?</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">If you are identifying the 
turbo as installed in a 3SGTE 3<sup>RD</sup> Generation as a “CT20B” then you 
are referring to an imaginary, non-existent turbo.&nbsp; The “CT20B” turbo exists 
only in the Internet.&nbsp; There is NO Official Toyota reference to this turbo in 
any Toyota Manual, Parts CD Rom, or sales literature.&nbsp; However, there is a REAL 
Toyota CT20 turbo used on the 3TGTE, 4TGTE, and 22RTE engines in the 80’s but 
this will not bolt on the 3SGTE twin-entry manifolds.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">The source of this 
misinformation and designation maybe based on (1) article on TTE website about 
the WRC Castrol Corolla.&nbsp; We have checked and seen the turbo as installed on the 
works car and it is NOT even a Toyota CT series turbo.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">We have ordered and sold 
many replacement turbos for the 3SGTE 3<sup>rd</sup> Generation engines.&nbsp; There 
is no casting designation identifying these turbos as CT20 or CT20 B.&nbsp; They are 
unmarked CT26 bodies.&nbsp; In some Toyota literature these 3SGTE 3<sup>rd</sup> 
Generation turbos are still referred to as the CT26.</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">There have been many 
3SGTE Celica and MR2 owners who have been misled into buying the real CT20 turbo 
from the older turbo engines.&nbsp; The seller is 100% correct in selling them as 
such with the casting # to prove so.&nbsp; Shops and individuals who pass the CT20 as 
upgrade for the 3SGTE- do not know any better.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Arial">The 4<sup>th</sup> 
Generation 3SGTE ?&nbsp; </span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">To prevent another 
controversy and correct widespread misinformation- the Caldina ST 215 / 246 
3SGTE should not and cannot be referred to as 3SGTE 4<sup>th</sup> Generation.&nbsp; 
There is a REAL 4<sup>th</sup> Generation 3SGE but they were not available with 
turbo.&nbsp; The 4<sup>th</sup> Generation head supports the VVTi valve set-up and 
has direct ignition.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">There are actually 2 
different 3SGTE 3<sup>RD</sup> Generation Engines- #1 as installed in the 1994 - 
up Celica ST205 and MR2 SW20 vehicles: the flange is similar to the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
Gen 3SGTE CT26&nbsp; with the Twin Entry flange and Ceramic impellers;&nbsp; #2 as 
installed in the Caldina ST215 / 246 Caldina- the turbo center section housing 
is cast in one piece with the exhaust manifold, also with Ceramic impellers.&nbsp; 
Again there is no identifying models on the turbo.</span></p>
<h1><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">The Race Engine 3SGTE</span></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Do not believe “3SGTE 
based” racing engines in Toyota ads.&nbsp; The racing “3SGTE” are not 3SGTEs- they 
are known internally at Toyota as 503- as used in IMSA, Pikes Peak, HKS drag 
car, and Le Mans.&nbsp; No internal or external parts are interchangeable.</span></p>
