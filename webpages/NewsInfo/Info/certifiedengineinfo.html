<h1><font color="#0000FF">Certification / Classification of Used Japanese 
Engines</font></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Car maintenance in Japan is different 
from the U.S. and most of the world.&nbsp; Without a license to work on vehicles, 
purchasing parts and even manuals is restricted.&nbsp; Safety related maintenance 
items like brakes are specially regulated.&nbsp; There are very few Do-It 
Yourselfers, considering that most cars are recycled in 5 years, there is almost 
no need to fix things.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">The availability of good low mileage 
used engine and drive train components from Japan is a result of all the 
factory-serviced vehicles and early recycling.&nbsp; Note too that since Japanese 
vehicles are hardly used for long trips- light brown deposits visible thru the 
filler cap do not translate to high mileage.&nbsp; Even dark tar-like deposits are 
sometimes only accumulated on the cylinder head.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">As all facets of car maintenance in 
Japan is regulated- so is the sale of used engines for Japan domestic use.&nbsp; 
There are 4 major classifications: Class A, B, C, and Export.&nbsp; The first 3 
classes are based on factors of mileage, maintenance records, and general 
condition.&nbsp; These engines have documentation from the recycling source- for 
reselling in Japan and are fully documented.&nbsp; Expect to pay about 25 – 50% more- 
if you want a certified used engine.&nbsp; This are available by special order (or 
check availability, occasionally we have some.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">The Export class- is of interest to most 
export markets. Engines that do not meet the specified criteria for the 3 
classification are classified Export-&nbsp; they cannot be resold in Japan.&nbsp; </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><b>It is important to note:&nbsp; just 
because the imported engines (from Japan) do not have a certificate- it does not 
meet the higher Japanese standards.&nbsp; </b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">It may mean that the recycler did not 
bother to have the engines certified.&nbsp; All large engine importers in the US buy 
the engines in bulk- what is sent is what they sell.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">We offer by special order CERTIFIED 
engines.</font></p>
