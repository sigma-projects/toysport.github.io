        <p><strong><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Some Things About 
        Toysport</span></strong><b><span style="font-family:Arial"><br>
        </span></b><span style="font-family:Arial"><br>
        In 1980 Toysport was established to distribute Toyota Racing Development 
        (TRD) sport parts. Toysport was also appointed as in-house consultant 
        for TRD USA, Toysport initiated the Toyota &quot;grass-root&quot; support 
        program.&nbsp; When Toyota USA formed Toyota Motorsport in 1981, the Toysport 
        program became the Toyota Motorsport Contingency Program.&nbsp; In 2004, 
        Toysport has remained in the forefront in meeting Toyota enthusiasts’ 
        needs.<br>
        <br>
        Team Toysport America Limited was incorporated in 1982 and actively 
        continued support of TRD Japan/USA.&nbsp; Toysport continues to supplement 
        and complement the activities of Toyota Motorsport.&nbsp; Toysport has 
        handled vehicle display for Toyota Motor Sales USA, and prepared 
        magazine cars for TRD USA and Toyota Public Relations.&nbsp; Toyota </span>
        <span style="font-family:
  Arial">Technical</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> Center and Toysport 
        have compared technical notes continually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Overseas, the principals of Toysport have 
worked with TOYOTA MOTOR CORP. (Japan) since 1965, and TOSCO (the original 
corporate name of TRD (Japan) since 1972. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">The initial thrust of Toysport was engine 
development and accessory distribution. Working with &quot;grassroots&quot; Toyota racing 
teams and U.S. parts manufacturers allowed Toysport to be in the center of parts 
development and competition preparation. Toysport's commitment to Toyota racers 
and enthusiasts was total and encompassing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">This commitment earned us the continued 
cooperation of TOYOTA, TRD (Technocraft), TRD USA, the aftermarket manufacturers 
and importers. Working continually in expanding and developing our Toyota 
product lines, affiliated businesses have responded to our needs by adding and 
supplementing our product lines. A natural result- Toysport is the leading 
Toyota Tuning Specialist and WD for Toyota sports parts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">In1985 Toysport achieved many milestones.&nbsp; 
From the leading winners in Toyota's contingency program to the top Toyota 
Racing Teams worldwide (TOM's Racing and TRUST of Japan), Toysport was actively 
involved in Motorsport activities. Our customers were entered in various SCCA, 
IMSA, SCORE and HDRA events. Our customers have won National championships for 
Toyota. Toysport entered international FIA sanctioned events and always placed 
in the top two positions in their classes, a perfect record. Multiple race track 
records were also set Willow Springs Raceway.<br>
<br>
Attention away from Motorsport activities was a result of the tremendous growth 
in Toyota aftermarket parts. 1985 and 1986 model years saw the strongest Toyota 
sports model line-up in U.S. Toyota history. The arrival of the Twin Cam Supras, 
Celicas, Corollas and MR2 and the appearance of factory Turbo engines- </span>
<span style="font-family:
  Arial">Toyota</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> performance was on a high 
note. The influx of more Japanese parts alleviated the need to develop parts 
locally. Toyota enthusiasts were abundant, and Toysport was THE SOURCE.<br>
<br>
In 1990 we purchased our present building. Our showroom has the most 
comprehensive display of sports parts; our service facility prepares engines and 
prototype work non-stop; our engine and chassis dyno allow continuous engine 
tuning and development. Toysport was also busy attending consumer / trade shows 
and preparing magazine vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Expanded foreign sales keep us busy 
identifying correct applications for foreign Toyota market models. We were 
exporting sports parts and accessories to Toyota enthusiasts and racers all over 
the world. Our expanded parts support for Old School and Milestone Toyota models 
has proven very successful and rewarding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">We have aggressively imported more varieties 
of Toyota engines than Toyota dared to bring in. Two, Four, Five valve TwinCam 
engines. Turbo, Super-charged, and Twin-charged. Single plug and Twin plug. 
Street, Prototype, Rally, and Racing. Been there, done that. Toyota Technicians 
from the different Toyota Regional centers continue to visit to see engines and 
cars that they only read about and seen in pictures. Toyota dealers call us for 
their customers’ special needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Every year we tease Toyota employees with 
Toysport prepared vehicles in the Toyota Oktoberfest car show at Toyota 
headquarters.<br>
<br>
Our expertise in Toyota tuning has opened other major venues. Our reputation led 
to some unsolicited factory contracts. We worked with Nissan Competition on some 
prototype turbo vehicles and raced Showroom Stock 300ZXs. We worked with Mazda 
in the introduction of the 2nd generation RX7 Turbo. We worked with Honda 
Research and Mugen on Honda turbos (in their old Gardena location). Naturally no 
important information was shared. It was exciting times and a continuing 
learning process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">The performance aftermarket changed in the 
90's, the sporty new models from Toyota stopped coming and current models 
disappeared.&nbsp; Ironically, the sports aftermarket was booming with the other 
sporty and exotic offerings from other manufacturers. We tuned and modified 
Nissans, Mazdas, and Hondas- but we proudly kept our Toyota hat on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">By 1995 Toyota diehards insisted in RWD and 
kept all the older RWD models rolling. Fortunately, we have managed to capture 
more of the Toyota specialty market. The different Toyota clubs send us 
membership business. Our resources for Toyota parts remain phenomenal and 
unbeatable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">In 2000, Toysport celebrated 20 years of 
service to the Toyota enthusiasts in the U.S. The first 20 years have proven 
challenging but very rewarding. Our clientele base, which has changed 
demographically and geographically- has continued to grow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">We are honored to be &quot;a pioneer of the import 
high performance industry&quot;, for &quot;being around forever&quot;, as the &quot;premier Toyota 
aftermarket specialist&quot; and being &quot;the ultimate skunkworks for modified 
Toyotas&quot;. Yes, we have had to defend Toyota and Toyota products to non-<i>Toyotaphiles</i> 
(and unhappy Toyota owners).&nbsp; Magazines continue to give us editorial space 
despite remaining basically non-advertisers.</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Somethings about Toyota Cars</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Toyotas never die; they just get modified and 
restored. The Starlets, Corollas, Celicas, Supras, and MR2s continue to come for 
fresh power, suspension upgrades, or total restoration. Yes, the exotic 2000GT, 
Sport 800, Century, Crown, and Soarer continued to call.&nbsp; Tercels, Camrys, and 
RAV4s are regulars. The Truck and SUV market has never been our focus, but we 
have prepared the best ones for the magazines and won National Championships!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">We work exclusively with 
Toyotas and have turbocharged and modified more Toyota models, than any other 
company.&nbsp; Is your car on our list?&nbsp; See our PROJECT CAR list. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">In 2005, the Celica and MR2 
bow out.&nbsp; The US Supra in 1997 (2000 in Japan).&nbsp; The Levin and Trueno are also 
gone.&nbsp; The AllTrac / GT4 Celica disappeared 1999.&nbsp; All have followed the Toyota 
2000GT- gone to Toyota’s great garage in the sky ….. , a couple left parked in 
my garage.&nbsp; Cherished orphaned nameplates now.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">The 4AGE and 3SGE had been 
retired.&nbsp; The 3SGTE is hiding in some non-descript Toyota.&nbsp; The 2JZGTE is soon 
to follow all the other great legendary Toyota Twin Cams of the performance 
variety: 3M, 2TG, 3TGTE, and 7MGTE.&nbsp; This has got to be the lowest point in 
Toyota product and engine line-up for the Toyota enthusiast.&nbsp; The 2ZZGE better 
hide or find an engine compartment quick!&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">So now we have collectibles.&nbsp; Have you ever 
wondered or can remember how much the Toyota you are modifying originally cost?&nbsp; 
After spending hundreds and thousands on parts and accessories- you will be so 
surprised that the cars are actually the cheapest “part” you ever bought- even 
if you bought it brand new!!!!&nbsp; See our article about TOYOTA HISTORIC PRICING.</span></p>
