<p><b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">TOYSPORT INTERNET DRIVE</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;color:black">Welcome to Toysport Internet 
Drive.&nbsp; This is the next best thing to an actual visit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">For many of our customers, a visit to 
Toysport is a surprise part of a vacation. Families from around the world come 
to visit the many sites of Southern California, and frequently the Toyota 
diehard in the family- manages to squeeze in time to visit our showroom and 
facility (the whole family in tow). Out-of-town business people often schedule 
LA meetings with added free time to drop-in.&nbsp; Toyota people from the different 
Regional offices, in town for Toyota corporate headquarters business, drop-in 
regularly to see what’s new. Race weekends bring car clubs and motor sports 
enthusiasts to continue bench-racing.&nbsp; Long holiday weekends bring drive-ins 
from all over California. Often, Toysport is the first and last stop, of an LA 
visit- first to order parts and then to pick-up the goods on the way home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">We have not disappointed our visitors- 
judging by their excited reaction when they see the most comprehensive display 
of Toyota sports parts. Some Toyota items that only we have made the visit 
totally worthwhile. Often, new inquiries and old questions are answered by a 
simple visit. Like a “tourist trap”- Toyota curios, gadgets, engines, 
accessories, and hardware are here to view, hold, examine, compare, and 
(hopefully!) purchase.&nbsp; Sometimes it is to meet the face of the voice on the 
phone or behind the e-mail address</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">There is nothing like Toysport, if you are a 
Toyota enthusiast. We are true Toyotaphiles. We enjoy and pamper our Toyotas. We 
are dedicated to making your Toyota, into the best Toyota. Like you, we are 
Toyota obsessed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Nothing that will replace a &quot;brick and 
mortar&quot; business. In this age of Ebay, did you ever wonder who actually stocks 
and more important- knows the products? Know-how and experience is developed by 
installing, using, testing, and evaluating the products. Hands on experience.&nbsp; 
Naturally, some technical information we have will need to remain proprietary. 
Some chat room denizens or websites in &quot;cyberspace&quot; claim a lot of experience, 
be careful and qualify what you read.&nbsp; Some sites have a lot of information but 
also more- misinformation!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">The articles on this TOYSPORT INTERNET DRIVE 
are presented in an informal conversational tone. We tried to keep it brief and 
interesting. The aim is to inform and is not meant to be instructional. </span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Please take a moment to read and review all 
the legalese, when they come up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">And so, here we proudly present the next best 
thing, enjoy your Internet visit……….come back often……….but see you soon anyway!</span><br>
