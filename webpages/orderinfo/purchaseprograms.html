  TO TOYOTA DEALERS:</b></font></p>
<font face="Arial">
<p align="left"><font size="2">We will accept orders covered by a Purchase Order signed by the Toyota Dealer’s
Part Manager only. We will need your Toyota Dealer Code. COD Company Check will
be accepted. Dealer employees may order directly from Toysport, but orders must
be pre-paid. California Toyota Dealers must submit copies of the CA Seller’s
Permit and a signed Resale Card.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" color="#0000FF" face="Arial"><b>NOTICE TO OUR DEALERS:</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">Effective July 1 2003, all current dealers must resubmit all contact
information, copies of business license, reseller’s permit, or export permit.
If you have not purchased in the last quarter ‘99, you also have to send your
bank and/or credit card information. Please send them as soon as possible or
your orders may be held up. We are preparing a new dealer list so that we can
refer customers to you directly. Your future orders should be faxed; this will
be used as order confirmation also. California Dealers must submit copies of the
CA Seller’s Permit and a signed Resale Card.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" color="#0000FF" face="Arial"><b>NOTICE FOR GROUP 
  PURCHASE:</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">If there is a part you want us to quote on, we will be happy to do so. From
time to time we will have Special Group Purchase deals. We will accept SGP’s
as a 1-time order, meaning 1 person will be responsible for the order and
payment for the group. Drop shipment is OK, and shipping will be charged
separately. We will not accept SGP’s from individual members of any group.
Minimum quantity requirements must be met, before the order is accepted.
Cashiers Check only.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" color="#0000FF" face="Arial"><b>NOTICE TO OVERSEAS 
  CUSTOMERS:</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">We will require copies of all shipping documents 5 days after delivery to
your shipper or forwarder. We will charge California sales taxes until we
receive the documentation. No refund of collected Sales Tax without proof of
export. No exceptions. You will be responsible for all your local taxes and
duties. Foreign credit card payments must include a letter with your signature
and description of parts ordered.</font></p>
