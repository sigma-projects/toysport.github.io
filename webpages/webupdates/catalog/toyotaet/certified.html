<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Car maintenance in Japan is 
different from the U.S. and most of the world.&nbsp; Without a mechanic’s license to 
work on vehicles, purchasing parts and even manuals is somewhat restricted.&nbsp; 
Safety related maintenance items like brakes are specially regulated.&nbsp; There are 
very few Do-It Yourselfers considering that most cars are recycled in 4 - 5 
years, there is almost no need to repair or replace parts.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">The availability of good 
low mileage used engine and drive train components from Japan is a result of all 
the warranty-serviced vehicles and early recycling.&nbsp; Note too that since 
Japanese vehicles are hardly used for long trips.&nbsp; Short trips are the norm, and 
brownish vapor residues that collect on the head (when seen from the filler cap) 
is a direct result and not an indication of low maintenance.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">As all facets of car 
maintenance in Japan is regulated- so is the sale of recycled engines for Japan 
domestic use.&nbsp; There are 3 major classifications: Class A, B,&nbsp; and Export.&nbsp; The 
basis are factored on mileage, maintenance records, and general condition.&nbsp; 
These engines have documentation from the recycling source- for reselling in 
Japan and are fully documented.&nbsp; Expect to pay a 25 – 50% premium- if you want a 
certified used engine.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">The Export engines range 
from low to high mileage.&nbsp; The major difference is that the engines were not 
documented as to the actual source and therefore cannot be resold in Japan.&nbsp; It 
may mean that the recycler did not bother to have the engines certified or they 
are above mileage units that cannot meet certification.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">All large engine importers 
in the US buy the engines in bulk- what is sent is what they sell.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Toysport can special order 
CERTIFIED engines.</span></p>
