  <font face="Arial" color="blue" size="4">LEXUS GS300 VERTEX HKS TWIN TURBO</font></b><font face="Arial" color="black" size="4"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;</span></font></h1>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2">
  <span style="color: black">The arrival of the of Lexus GS 300 
  in the US (the Aristo in Japan), was a highly welcomed and anticipated event 
  at Toysport and by the whole Toyota enthusiasts community.&nbsp; It is widely known 
  that finally Lexus had a model that was available with the potent Toyota 
  2JZGTE turbo engine (in Japan).&nbsp; So we anxiously waited for the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
  Generation, hoping the turbo model will come Stateside.&nbsp; The new model change 
  was an opportunity for Lexus to introduce a TRUE high performance model- that 
  can outperform most European “factory tuned” models.&nbsp; And the availability of 
  aftermarket upgrades guaranteed a world class performance touring machine.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2">
  <span style="color: black">It was not to be….. and into the 
  mid-model change there was still none. So we decided, collected parts, and 
  went on to build one. Think about it- this is how Toyota keeps Toysport in 
  business!&nbsp; The JZX161 Aristo in Japan came with the 2<sup>nd</sup> Generation 
  2JZGTE VVTi.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Officially known as the Vertex edition, the 2JZGTE came 
  upgraded with Intelligent Variable Valve Timing.&nbsp;&nbsp; (1997 Supras in Japan also 
  benefited from this mid-model upgrade, but was never available in the U.S.)&nbsp;
  </span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2">
  <span style="color: black">Fully-Built 2JZGTE’s are usually 
  based on the Non-VVTi engine, so the set-up we used was the reliable and 
  proven 1<sup>st</sup> Gen 2JZGTE with the HKS Twin-Turbo GT2835 with all the 
  HKS Electronics support.&nbsp; Being HKS’ First US distributor they happily obliged 
  Toysport with everything in their catalog.&nbsp; From air intake to exhaust, all 
  electronic controls and suspension too!!- was all HKS.&nbsp; TRD parts were 
  originally planned for the suspension and other chassis components- but 
  conflict with the L-Tune concept being developed by TRD USA and Lexus Division 
  was deferred to. The only custom fabricated parts were fitting the largest HKS 
  intercooler available (which fit nicely under the hallowed out bumper cover- 
  with just a 2mm sharp corner (of the intercooler) pushing up the bumper face) 
  and a modified down pipe (the kit was based on a Supra install).&nbsp; Enough said.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2">
  <span style="color: black">The car had to be rewired-&nbsp; the 
  Lexus factory electronics in the GS is the most fully integrated system 
  encompassing engine management, vehicle stability, vehicle security, vehicle 
  GPS, sound system, and probably a monitoring mode that records how the car was 
  driven- for warranty purposes.&nbsp; With the rewire- all active electronic 
  controls went out with all the wires (ending up on the shop floor). </span>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2">
  <span style="color: black">Pure and simple- this was one of 
  the fastest car Toysport ever built.&nbsp; </span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2">
  <span style="color: black">There was something odd about this 
  conversion though, and if you read all of our Project Car articles closely you 
  will know why.&nbsp; Toysport usually upgrades the mechanical aspect and this was 
  actually a retro-fitment.&nbsp; So the whole set-up was replaced and redone with 
  the new and correct 2JZGTE VVTi- of course the HKS hardware all managed to 
  stay. </span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2">
  <span style="color: black">The VVTi engine now awaits some 
  more upgraded HKS electronic pieces…… No rush to finish this now since we now 
  know how it will run….advantage of the newer engine will be throttle-reponse 
  and of course, bragging rights.&nbsp; A Lexus is a Toyota.&nbsp; And&nbsp; Toyotas we know 
  very, very well……….</span></font></div>
