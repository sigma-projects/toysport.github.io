        <h1><font size="4">Celica ST 204 3SGE 3<sup>rd</sup> Gen </font> </h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">The Celica ST 200 series got the 
upgraded 3SGE 3<sup>rd</sup> Gen engines when they were introduced in 1994.&nbsp; 
This engine never made it to the U.S. (and neither did the 2<sup>nd</sup> Gen 
3SGE in the ST 180 series).&nbsp; The 3SG engines were discontinued in the U.S. in 
1991.&nbsp; In Japan and the rest of the world, Toyota continued to upgrade and sell 
the 3SGEs.&nbsp; The 3<sup>rd</sup> Gen 3SGE and 3SGTE turbo engines continued to be 
available, in Japan and the rest of the world.&nbsp; The 5SFE was a unique American 
market engine only.&nbsp; The AT200 with the 7AF engine was a true joke- passed on to 
the bewildered Celica owners.&nbsp; A true farce when Toysport considers the Celica 
owners as the most loyal and diehard Toyota owners!!</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">The 3SGE 3<sup>rd</sup> Gen engine was 
introduced with 170HP, with a shim under bucket head set-up.&nbsp; This allows 
radical cam upgrades without the danger of the adjustment shims flying off.&nbsp; A 
true naturally-aspirated, high performance engine in the Toyota tradition of 
Twin Cams&nbsp; for Celicas.&nbsp; This engine was installed in our 1997 Celica, after we 
pulled out the ST205 engine.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">If Toyota had installed this engine in 
the U.S. cars, this last generation Celicas with the S engines would have sold 
really well.&nbsp; The aggressive looks finally had the power to back it up.&nbsp; It is a 
real shame that this generation Celica - with rigid body and superior 
accommodations was not only underpowered- but it’s most potent version the ST205 
was not even imported for the Celica ST165 and ST185 enthusiasts.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">The 3SGE 3<sup>rd</sup> Gen engine 
dropped right in.&nbsp; If you are conversion handicapped, we can get the exact 
brackets from Japan.&nbsp; The difference between 5SFE and real 3SGE is phenomenal.&nbsp; 
The car feels healthier and sportier with the correct engine.&nbsp; You begin to 
wonder whether you should import the Super Strut suspension too, to get the 
maximum impact of what Celicas are suppose to be- even in FWD form.&nbsp; (The Super 
Strut suspension is an entirely different front suspension system.)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Toysport stays in business by upgrading 
Celicas and other Toyota models.&nbsp; We will fill in all the gaps Toyota and TRD 
leaves open for us.&nbsp; Yes the Camry is a best seller- fully refined and well 
equipped for it’s market position- but us enthusiasts aspire for more than 
Camry. This Celica “upgrade” to stock JDM specifications makes us wonder what 
Toyota is really up to.&nbsp; So- give your Celica this minimum upgrade, or go with a 
3SGTE. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Some related thoughts:</b>&nbsp; The 
replacement Celica generation ZZT series proves that Toyota realized this 
mistake.&nbsp; Although the new Celica is more a Levin / Trueno replacement- in size 
and engine availability- we will take the new Celica as true Celicas….wonder if 
a 3SGE/GTE will work…..</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Altezza Dual VVTi 3SGE.&nbsp; Since the 
Altezza was RWD it was a hard install on the MR2s and Celicas- but the single 
VVTi is a drop in.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Naturally- we had to install one at 
first opportuniyty- an MR2 NA with 180,000 miles, whose owner was wary of turbo 
engines- was first in line.&nbsp; We had received 2 brand new engines from Toyota and 
wanted to see what it would be like.&nbsp; For this install we used a header with 
built-in catalytic converters (duals for 1-4 and 2-3) to see if it will pass 
California’s strict emission standards; we have not done it yet- but- it has 
provisions casted in the head to fit in an EGR.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">We ordered the engine harness from Japan 
for the VVTi engine and the only problem we encountered were the connectors to 
the chassis harness.&nbsp; They are different- available Japan only.&nbsp; (We will supply 
these connectors if you decide you need this engine too.)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Power delivery is unbelievable- 
reaffirming our belief that Toyota still is the leader on any Twin-Cam 
technology.&nbsp; Although a little late in offering the variable-timing cam 
technology- Toyota has delivered the best available in the market- thank you 
YAMAHA!!!&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Aside from the special exhaust manifold, 
we fabricated a connector to an HKS turbo muffler- a little bit noisy, but we 
wanted absolutely no power restriction on this end.&nbsp; Naturally we upgraded the 
shocks and springs- Eibach and Tokico Illuminas, still the best all around 
set-up.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">A lot of our project cars are based on 
installing JDM specification engines in older Toyota models, and this proves to 
be one of the easier and most rewarding ones.&nbsp; You cannot beat the factory in 
tuning engines, you just have to wait when they become available in the HP range 
you want.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">We plan further tuning of this engine 
combination with cams and other electrical gizmos….&nbsp; maybe a 2200cc version too… 
So that the MR2 NA crowd will be able to run and play- “all engine”…… stay in 
tune</font></p>
