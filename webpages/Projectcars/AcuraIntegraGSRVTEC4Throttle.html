        </font><font face="Arial">Featured in the February 1994 issue of CARBOY, a Japanese car enthusiast magazine, 
  this car was modified with 4 individual throttle bodies. CARBOY featured the 
  vehicle because of the unique induction set-up for the VTEC engine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>(That issue was dedicated to U.S. Tuning of Japanese vehicles.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The Honda VTEC engine design was introduced at the same time Toyota introduced 
  the 20Valve / 4Throttle 4AG.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We 
  anxiously wanted to find the tuning potential of the variable cam timing design, 
  and there were no U.S. Toyota models.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>A custom intake was fabricated to align perfectly the throttle 
  bodies into the intake ports.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>An 
  Electromotive Tech II was used to easily program different fuel and ignition 
  curves- and also to test (and learn!) the affectivity of VTEC technology.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>To fully document the results the engine was not modified.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>To assure affectivity and complement the state-of-the-art intake, DC 
  headers and an HKS exhaust was used.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 
  result was a dramatic increase in throttle response- off idle, part-throttle, 
  and past the redline.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A Formula 
  2, screaming engine!!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 4-Throttle 
  set-up proved a definite performance upgrade to the Honda engine, but was very 
  expensive, more than a turbo kit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In 
  retrospect, the Toyota 20Valve 4Throttle set-up, introduced in Japan a few months 
  earlier was short in HP! (and 200cc) and did not have a variable lift.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The new Celica 2ZZGE engine finally catches up, a “little” 
  late- 9 years, but at least in the same decade.</font></span><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
