  &nbsp;</font></b><font face="Arial" size="2">The 7MGTE transplant into this 
  RA60 Celica was done to showcase Toysport tuning and convertion capability. 
  The 7MGTE was bored out to 3100cc using forged Toysport pistons and an HKS Metal 
  Headgasket.. A modified oil pan and pump were fabricated to install the engine 
  in the &quot;short&quot; chassis. The head received minor port clean-up and 
  all manifolds were EXTRUDE HONED. An HKS TwinTurbo manifold was used using twin 
  TURBONETICS prepared T2.5/T3s. A four-row HKS Intercooler with a three row custom 
  radiator were fitted to handle all the cooling. The car was rewired using 7MGTE 
  electronics, supplemented by an HKS F-Con controlling HKS 550cc. injectors, 
  HKS VPC, HKS EVC, and HKS SBV. The exhaust used modified HKS 3&quot; exhaust. 
  Front custom sway-bars were made by SWAY AWAY, who also supplied the rear bar. 
  Tokico Sport Springs and Illumina 5-way adjustable shocks complete the suspension. 
  To keep the sutble enhanced look- projector lights were built-in the corner/signal 
  lights; the front bumper was ventilated for the turbo intercooler; to complete 
  the up-dated performance look- Recaro C seats in gray leather and SSR Racing 
  Wheels 16x8 and 16x9 with 225/285Pirelli tires were added. Featured in the 1994 
  February issue of CARBOY, a Japanese published Automobile Magazine. Also appeared 
  in the 1992 July issue of TURBO MAGAZINE.</font></p>
