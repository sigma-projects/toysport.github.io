        RAV-4 GT-FOUR 3S-GTE</font></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">A RAV4 Toyota can make.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The parts were here almost a year, before the RAV4 finally arrived in 
  the U.S.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The TRD WAYDO springs, 
  shocks, sway bars, and even the stickers!; a crated 2<sup>nd</sup> generation 
  3SGTE GT-4 engine (with intercooler); collected pieces from other turbo projects- 
  Supra intercooler, fuel pump, HKS this-and-that;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>(Four!) Recaro seats… Immediately the RAV was stripped and the engine 
  installed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bolt-on no modifications!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The Engine management was converted to Japan Spec instead of the US OBD 
  II.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The suspension pieces were 
  all bolt-in also except for the shocks- Tokico 5-way adjustable Illuminas were 
  used instead of the WAYDO, for adjustability.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>(This is only possible on early RAV4’s with the old style strut housings! 
  Sorry.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The engine intercooler 
  was replaced with a front mount Supra unit (a better set-up than the top-mount 
  on the Celicas).<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>A modified HKS exhaust (off an AllTrac Celica) finished the 
  exhaust system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>An HKS VPC and 
  EVC were used to up the boost to 12 psi (to preserve the drivetrain).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Blitz 17 X 8 BRW01 wheels with Yokohama AVS/ST 255 /45/17 tires, gave 
  the RAV an aggressive stance- just the right look- potent. Not cute.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>With the suspension and wheel change the RAV sat 2” lower than stock.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The drivetrain was retained in all original form, except for the clutch 
  which used a TRD unit.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The end result was a RAV4 with a completely stock Japanese 
  spec 3SGTE that will do ¼ mile run in the low 13’s/ high 12’s, with an easy 
  no burn-out launch.&nbsp;<o:p> </o:p> </font></p>
