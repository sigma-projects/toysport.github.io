        Celica RA64 GT-TS 3T-GTE</font></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">The 22RE Celica GTS was available 
  only for the U.S. market.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The low 
  speed high torque engine was perfectly suited to U.S. driving conditions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>We have raced this 22RE engine in a Celica in Macao, the most famous 
  international racecourse in South East Asia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>We placed 3<sup>rd</sup>, behind 2 Six-cylinder factory prepared BMWs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>In Japan the Celica GT and GTS models were equipped with an 18RG/GEU 
  for earlier models and a 3TGTE since 82.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The 3TGTE was based on the 2TG/18RG models, but upgraded to turbo and 
  twin-spark plugs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Why did we do 
  this project?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In one of the shipments 
  we received from Japan, we were sent a complete engine and transmission- with 
  full harness, ECU, airflow meter, igniter, etc., including the air-cleaner, 
  engine accessories (steering pump, AC compressor, igniters) and even a down-pipe!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>It called for a factory original install into a U.S. body.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Everything fits, except the turbo exhaust- which was conveniently replaced 
  with a 22RTE unit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 3TGTE uses 
  the same turbo as the 22RTE, with the only difference being the exhaust side 
  housing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Since this is basically 
  a Japanese spec car- the HKS F-Con for the 3TGTE and turbo exhaust were available 
  and bolted in perfectly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This was 
  too easy a 2-day project!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now we 
  had a companion to our Group B Celica.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Toysport likes having pairs for everything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The suspension is Eibach with Tokico Illuminas and Sway-Away stabilizer 
  bars.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Wheels were stock 14 X 7, 
  to keep the stock look.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The only 
  thing replaced on the body was the trunk emblem- it now reads GT-TS, the correct 
  designation.<o:p> </o:p></font></p>
