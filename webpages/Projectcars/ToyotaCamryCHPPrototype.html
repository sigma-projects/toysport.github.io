        <h2><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF" size="4">TOYOTA 
        CAMRY - California Highway Patrol Prototype </font></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman; color: black">How 
  is this for a change?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When the 
  California Highway Patrol wanted a Toyota Camry to test as a CHP vehicle- they 
  also gave an 80+ list that the vehicle must be equipped with and modified to 
  perform.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The must list included: 
  standards for acceleration, sustained top speed, an hour idle capability, slalom 
  course agility, electrical reserve: stand-by (engine off) and full chase (siren/lights 
  on), 250 lbs. seat standard w/ easy access<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>(to accommodate side firearms!), tire specifications, among other things.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The strangest requirement was that the vehicle must be able to jump 7-inch 
  curbs at least 40 times without suspension or wheel damage!<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>TRD USA coordinated the project build-up and Toysport was in 
  charge of procuring most of the parts. <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>There were two units to prepare- one was a Camry All-Trac (4 
  cylinder 5-speed) and the other was the (then) new V6 FWD. Gathering the parts 
  was actually fun. No budget and access to any Toyota part!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The units came from Toyota Denver Region- so they had the heavy-duty 
  electricals, good for at least 10-12 items off the list.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Going over Toyota parts microfiche for overseas models yielded- a heavy-duty 
  radiator, 15X6 steel wheels, HD wheel studs, heavy-duty suspension bushings, 
  and another 17-20 pieces off the list.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The TRD catalog added another 12-15 more parts- brake pads, suspension, 
  clutch, etc.</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman; color: blue">&nbsp; 
  </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman; color: black">The 
  TRD Rally springs and shocks from the Celica All-Trac fit with minor modifications.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Lower arms and strut housings were reinforced (those curbs was a recurring 
  nightmare).<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Sway-Away bent some hefty sway bars and push bars.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Upper strut bars were Celica pieces.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Recaro Police seats with low side bolsters were mounted on lowered seat 
  rails (headroom for their CHP hats!). Police tires from Goodyear. A modified 
  and programmable ECU from Nippon Denso 9we kept one!) and new exhaust were the 
  only engine mods. We were not allowed to touch the engine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The 3SGTE was ready!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It 
  is so strange to see a black and white CHP Camry in complete police trim. Yes, 
  we tried and tried the siren and intercom (to test electrical load…), and no, 
  we could not drive it!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-family:Times New Roman; color:black">
