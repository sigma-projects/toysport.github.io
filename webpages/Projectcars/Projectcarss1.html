<a style="text-decoration: none" href="../../Projectcarsdisclaimer.html">THE LIST</a></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">These are the Toysport 
Project Cars.&nbsp; This is our resume.&nbsp; We listed all the different chassis and 
engine combinations we had actually worked on (and can remember…..).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Some in the list we had 
done several of, with minor detail differences.&nbsp; Some built out of challenge, 
some out of boredom.&nbsp; Some built on inspiration, some with obsession.&nbsp; Some to 
simply win a bet it could be done!!&nbsp; Some cobbled together on the leanest 
budget, some on <i>deep pocket</i> unlimited funding.&nbsp; Some built and finished 
on schedule, most took forever to finish ….. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">We stopped counting at 
300+ and trimmed the list to similar combinations.&nbsp; (Our apologies if your car 
was left out, call us so we can add it on.)&nbsp; The list still looks mighty 
impressive ! </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">From the most exclusive 
Toyota models to the most important Toyota Corporate VIP – Toysport has worked 
on all of them for all of them. There were as many reasons to build these cars 
or engines, as there are chassis/engine combinations Toyota has produced through 
the years.&nbsp; Some conversions, we refused outright when it did not make sense.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Some were featured 
magazine cars (from the most reputable magazines to the editorially challenged 
life-style types); some were built for display or car shows (from Toyota 
commercials / public relation events to the local High Schools auto fairs); some 
were entered and prepared for competition- winners in ALL.&nbsp; Internationally 
several were featured in Japanese video / magazines and most recently by a 
Canadian TV show.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">The most common comments – 
“Toyota should have done it this way!”; “You sure it will work?”; “It will take 
HOW LONG?”; and of course the ever hopeful “You do sponsorships?”&nbsp; Most started 
by a simple “Can you ….. ?”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Been there, done that.&nbsp; 
When Toysport talks Toyota, you know right away: Toysport knows Toyota cars, 
engines, conversions, and parts.&nbsp; (Maybe not in the minutest and most obsessive 
compulsive detail, but unparalleled in hands on experience.)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Talent and time.&nbsp; Money 
and manuals.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Enjoy reading the 
articles.&nbsp; </span></p>
