  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">The statute of 
  limitations allow for unprosecutable acts after a certain amount of years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  So we waited more than ten years to tell this.&nbsp; In keeping with Toysport’s 
  policy of anonymous characters in all project cars, you will have to guess who 
  were involved. The cast of characters have dispersed, and are safely remote 
  from possible sanctions.&nbsp; </font> </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">This all happened in 
  1989.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">A statement of fact-</font></span></b><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2"> 
  we were first to modify the original LS 400, so technically the first to 
  modify a Lexus !.&nbsp;&nbsp; The conspirators involved ranged from the highest 
  positions in Toyota USA: the Executive Office, Product Planning, Technical 
  Center, Vehicle Services, ……in each department there was a Toyota enthusiast 
  who despite the conservative corporate structure at Lexus, helped out.&nbsp; This 
  actually was not a conspiracy- since they really did not know what collective 
  support they individually have given and what we were doing.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">When the Lexus brand was 
  introduced, the product was well protected in terms of market positioning, 
  magazine editorials, and so on.&nbsp; The Lexus as delivered is as perfect a car 
  can be.&nbsp; So when we received a silver LS 400, for “product evaluation”- we 
  were not suppose to modify anything.&nbsp; We were bound and honored that premise.&nbsp; 
  .At Toysport, the aura of LEXUS, that Toyota heavily invested in, is and&nbsp; was 
  well respected.&nbsp; </font> </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">In the course of 
  evaluation, we happened to receive a set of the European Spec brakes- these 
  were original factory issue front calipers and big rotors (for European bound- 
  Celsiors).&nbsp; These were factory parts, so they were upgrades- no modification 
  needed.&nbsp; They were put on.&nbsp; The catalytic converters on the vehicle were 
  damaged in a curb incident, so they were replaced with Supra Turbo units.&nbsp; The 
  LS stopped quicker and accelerated better.&nbsp; For the first time, a Lexus driver 
  was seen with a bigger grin and not just a discrete smile!&nbsp; Yes it beat a Q45, 
  no sweat, driven by the Nissan Motorsport Director.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">There was talk of racing 
  the 1UZFE engines (in a US based sports car series) and we found 2 engines to 
  teardown and inspect.&nbsp; For the class the car was suppose to enter- we gave an 
  honest opinion that the buttom-end was not strong enough to run at the RPM 
  level needed to develop the HP required.&nbsp; But we found some interesting things 
  to do to the head.&nbsp; And so we prepared a pair.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">A good old friend Mr. HH, 
  happened to stop by to visit.&nbsp; He was a publisher of one of the original 
  Sports Car magazines (so much unlike the current crop) and a Bonneville 
  veteran.&nbsp; He was inquiring about the LS for a magazine article he wanted to do 
  for Toyota.&nbsp; Put two-guys who like cars together- and you are immediately 
  talking about racing.&nbsp; The topic quickly changed about a Lexus magazine 
  article- into entering the Lexus in the Nevada Silver State challenge (1990).&nbsp; 
  A 100+ mile flat-out race against the clock on closed public highway.&nbsp; So 
  officially I turned over the Lexus to the magazine.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">And we were all laughing 
  at how the people at Lexus would react-</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">By sheer coincidence, 
  the same week we had a visitor from Germany, Mr. Eibach, accompanied by 
  another pioneer in the suspension technology business.&nbsp; Talk revolved around 
  how Japanese cars were not cut out for the high-speed autobahns of Europe.&nbsp; So 
  we gave them the springs and sway bars off the Lexus to prototype some 
  pieces.&nbsp; We needed a high speed suspension set-up for the Nevada event and 
  they had the experience to design the set-up. </font> </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">The engine was set-up 
  with modified heads, the exhaust with turbo cats and custom exhaust.&nbsp; 
  Suspension was custom wound by Eibach and tires were by Goodyear.&nbsp; Gearing was 
  adjusted to reach 160 MPH @ 500RPM below redline.&nbsp; We figured a Class win was 
  all we needed.&nbsp; The car had two runs to San Francisco and the set-up was 
  finalized.&nbsp; For sure a lot of people will be surprised. </font> </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Two weeks before the 
  event, there was a PR problem with Goodyear tires on the Lexus LS 400’s- and 
  Lexus in their obsessive protection of name and product absolutely clamped 
  down on all news sources and events.&nbsp; Goodyear argued that tire was not the 
  problem, but the specification Lexus supplied (for the OE tire)…and wanted us 
  to run wiyh Goodyear Performance tires to prove their point.&nbsp; But we parked 
  the car- we can always choose a different tire brand, but we prefer driving 
  Toyotas- even if says Lexus on the trunk.</font></span></p>
