        BEEN THERE, DONE THAT. For many years this black Toyota 4X4 kept getting re-incarnated. 
  Finally Supra turbo power- ended the search. A quick review- Mikunis/Cam/Headers- 
  BEEN THERE. Toysport-spec SCORE/HDRA engine- BEEN THERE. Supercharger /forged 
  pistons- BEEN THERE. Exit 22R. Final edition- 7MGTE with full automatic 4X4 
  transmission and transfer case. A modified torque converter was installed with 
  the HKS Automatic transmission upgrade, to handle the potent power source and 
  maintain 4WD characteristics. The modified 7MGTE with full electronics from 
  a Supra was shoehorned into the engine compartment. A full HKS Stage 6 conversion 
  made the work a little easier for 439 HP. This conversion was completed with 
  HD radiator, twin-electric fans, 2 row intercooler, oil cooler, transmission 
  cooler, differential coolers (to cool everything down) and of course air-conditioner 
  (a must keep, that caused a lot of problems) to cool the driver. The only non-Toyota 
  part was the 9&quot; Ford rear end that still kept breaking!!! Four wheel burn-outs 
  were unbelievable and impressive- for a 4WD Toyota. A full Rancho suspension 
  with ARB lockers was also installed, with reinforced suspension mounts, stiffened 
  axle housings, and custom driveshaft. This truck was used for all it had! RECARO 
  seats and a full SIMPSON harness were the only interior option. Before Ivan 
  Stewart got his V8- this was the fastest Toyota powered Truck. As seen on the 
  January 1991 issue of Four Wheeler Magazine- &quot;this was the fastest Toyota 
  Truck we ever tested&quot;. DONE.</font></p>
