<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">The 1985 Celica ST was the simplest of 
the last generation RWD Celicas.&nbsp; The 1997 2JZGTE Twin Turbo (Supra) engine 
was the most powerful engine Toyota ever imported. Fortunately the (even 
older) 1979 Supra rear axle bolts right in.&nbsp; So what we have here is a project 
that spans 1979 to 1997.&nbsp; We had the best pieces to do an ultimate project.&nbsp; The 
Celica ST is bare-bones and had solid axles, that was replaced with the heavier 
7.5” Supra differential (needed to survive the mega horsepower planned from the 
Supra Twin-Turbo engine).&nbsp; The engine was modified with Toysport forged pistons, HKS metal head gasket, ARP bolts, and the Traction Control bypassed.&nbsp; A massive 
Toyo Intercooler (XXXXX)&nbsp; the biggest intercooler we could get from Japan, fit 
behind the modified front bumper/grille.&nbsp; The ECU was modified to Toysport 
specs.&nbsp; A Toysport aluminum flywheel with twin-discs connect the 6 speed 
transmission.&nbsp; Unlike the other 7MGTE Celica convertions we had done before, the 
firewall had to be modified, to better position the weight bias.&nbsp; (On the 
7MGTE’s we maintained the original W-series transmission location.)&nbsp; Fiberglass 
Group B fenders (original Toyota Homologation items) were the only non-original 
body panel.&nbsp; The hood was lifted 2” at the back to help engine bay ventilation.&nbsp; 
The 3 stage Supra Twin Turbo fuel pump was installed in the tank.&nbsp; Suspension is 
with TRD Springs and Tokico Pro-Drag shocks.&nbsp; Now if HKS sends us their TWIN 
TURBO upgrade………hint…hint…hint…<o:p> </o:p>
