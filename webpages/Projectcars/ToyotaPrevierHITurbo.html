        Toyota Previa HI Turbo</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial" size="2">Before Toyota announced the 
  availability of the Supercharged Previa we were seriously looking into Turbocharging 
  one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately- no one wanted 
  to lend us one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And Toyota Previas 
  were having a cooling problem.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When 
  we first drove the factory SC model, we were expecting a lot more and were unimpressed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The comparison was just begging to be made,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>which was better- turbocharger or supercharger!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>After some research, an IHI RHB6 looked like a perfect bet to go heads 
  up against the factory SC14.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One 
  day we were doing an oil change on a Previa- and looking from underneath the 
  vehicle with the slanted engine- I made a bet with the owner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>I bet that I can install and have the turbo running in 48 hours.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Deal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And yes it was running 
  in 48 hours.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And yes, it blew away 
  Toyota’s SC model at only 7 psi.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 
  major technical challenge was mounting the turbo high enough to drain properly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Since the engine was already on it’s side- there was less than 10 inches 
  of room to position the turbo and have it drain properly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Oil coming from the turbo is whipped oil- and we had to design an oil 
  accumulator to liquefy the oil to drain properly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>We ended with a 12 inch tube that acted both as accumulator/liquefier 
  and the actual drain to the oil pan!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Additional 
  fuel was thru an HKS AIC (Additional injector Controller) and ignition upgraded 
  with HKS Twin Power.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Several weeks 
  later, in an accident- the engine overheated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>We changed the pistons to the factory SC units (bored .50mm over), upgraded 
  to SC injectors, and cranked the boost to 15 psi!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>It pulls like a 5 liter- from 2400 RPM when the boost starts.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">
<font face="Arial" size="2">The 
  heavier the Previa was loaded- the nicer the turbo performed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Advantage Turbo.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Suspension 
  is by WAYDO from TRD.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Wheels are 
  Blitz Type03 17X8 225/45-17, 17X9 235/45-17&nbsp;</font></p>
