  </font></b><font face="Arial" size="2">The 22RTE engine was completely 
  prepared using Toysport forged turbo pistons, ARP assembly bolts, and an Isky 
  Turbo cam. The original turbo set-up was replaced with a Toysport Stainless 
  Steel Turbo manifold with a Toyota Supra CT26 turbo controlled by a BLITZ Super 
  Blow-off valve. The 22RTE ECU was modified by TECH-TOM to run 430cc injectors. 
  The intercooler was also a Supra issue mounted in front of the radiator. A custom 
  heat shield protects other components under the hood. The clutch is a Centerforce 
  Dual Friction. Suspension in the front use Sway-Away torsion bars and blocks 
  are installed in the rear. Tokico High Performance shocks and ST swaybars complete 
  the suspension upgrade. The front brake rotors and calipers are upgraded together 
  with Teflon brake lines. In the interior gray leather Recaro XTs are installed 
  with MOMO Steering wheel, shiftknob, and boots. 4Runner upgrades include doors 
  and fenders. A 7 piece Autometer gauge set monitors all engine and speed functions. 
  Original Toyota European lenses are used, with Diamond-cut headlamps. Wheels 
  and tires are Blitz Wheel type 03, 17x8 front, 17x9 rear with Falken FK-04GRB 
  Tires.</font></p>
