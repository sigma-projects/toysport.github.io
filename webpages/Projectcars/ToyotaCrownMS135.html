        Crown MS135</font></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black"><font size="2" face="Arial">People 
  who have unique Toyotas come to Toysport for their needs, when and after Toyota 
  dealers turn them away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We got 
  a call from a distressed owner with a “Toyota Crown with a special 6MGE engine”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Yes, we told him “we can help you”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The engine was covered with burned oil- just like a Supra 5MGE when the 
  cam towers and valve covers start to leak.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The 6MGE is a stroked version of the 5MGE- 3000 vs. 2800cc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The problem was handled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When 
  the owner went back to Japan, he happily sold us the car.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>When Lexus division started in 1990, the world press and more, the U.S. 
  press excitedly monitored how Toyota will fare in the up-scale market.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Little did they know that Toyota has been building cars more sophisticated 
  and luxurious than European offerings!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>This Toyota Crown is a good example of how Toyota was so far advanced- 
  air vents that oscillate, front/rear/left/right air-conditioning control, seats 
  that recline flat, rear seats that tilt back, air suspension, no beverage holders 
  (but factory installed cool-box), dimming rear-view mirrors, and a host of other 
  nice luxury car touches that even current Mercedes and LS 400’s do not even 
  have!<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Even dual 3<sup>rd</sup> brake lights.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>And so Toyota succeded with the Lexus name….but Toyota owners 
  knew and had it all along…….we are witness to that.</font></span><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font><o:p><font size="2">
