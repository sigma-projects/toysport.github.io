<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><b><span style="color: blue">CONVERSION 
PACKAGE</span></b><span style="color: blue">-</span>&nbsp; What you get are all the 
mechanical parts to do an engine conversion: engine with harness, afm or map 
sensor, ecu, coil/igniter, and transmission.&nbsp; Depending on the engine, sometimes 
the original engine accessories and some electrical components&nbsp; (coil/igniter, 
afm or map sensor) are reusable- so the packages may be slightly different.&nbsp; 
Prices are quoted depending on what is minimally included.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><b><span style="color: blue">FRONT / 
REAR CLIPS</span></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Often times we get partial cuts, where the engine and 
transmission still sit on the chassis.&nbsp; Sometimes axles and struts, radiators 
and condensers are included, depending on the cut that we receive.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sheetmetal 
is never included, but sometime are left on the clip.&nbsp;&nbsp; Usually these are 
special orders.&nbsp; Due to the recent increase in freight classification- shipping 
cross country can cost as much as $1000+…&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; example MR@ rear clip</font></p>

REPLACEMENT PACKAGE</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;

font-family:Arial"> </span>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
font-weight:normal">this will come as a complete engine with manifolds; the 
engines come without the accessories (alternator, power-steering pump, AC 
compressor; normally this is ordered to replace the same or similar engine.&nbsp; 
Some electrical parts (distributor, coil packs, sensors) are usually left with 
the engine, but are not part of what you paid for.&nbsp; example:&nbsp; 5MG to 6MG 
upgrades</span></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><b><span style="color: blue">LONG BLOCK 
ENGINE</span></b><span style="color: blue">-</span>&nbsp; this will be the cylinder 
head and block- valve cover to oil pan.&nbsp; No manifolds.&nbsp; all internal parts are 
as installed on the head and block.&nbsp; your original manifolds may work with 
slight modification.&nbsp; example:&nbsp; 3SGTE blue-printed and built engines</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><b><span style="color: blue">SHORT BLOCK</span></b><span style="color: blue">-</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
this will be the engine block only, with crankshaft and pistons;&nbsp; Japanese 
blocks will interchange with U.S. blocks with no problem;&nbsp; if you intend to use 
as a street engine use this with your original U.S. head and emission controls; 
these blocks are usually updated versions.&nbsp; example: hi-compression 4AGE to U.S 
4AGE</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><b><span style="color: red">NOTE:</span></b>&nbsp; 
These engines are all Japanese specification and do not have EGR provisions, 
some can be retrofitted, some cannot; and some where never imported into the 
U.S.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although most engines will pass a tailpipe test, they are not legal for 
U.S. certification without an EGR retrofit.&nbsp; <b>Toysport imports and sells 
Japanese specification engines for competition use only.</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Expect to change all tune-up related 
parts- sparkplugs, distributor wire/cap/rotor; thermostat; timing/fan belts.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
For high performance engines changing rings and head-gasket is recommended, but 
most engines sold are used by our customers as received.&nbsp; On older model 
engines, reconditioning is highly recommended.&nbsp; <b>There is no warranty on high 
performance engines.</b><span style="font-size: 16.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></p>
