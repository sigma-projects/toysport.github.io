<h2>WHAT TO BUY (USED ENGINES)</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: blue">FRONT / REAR 
CLIPS-</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp; engine and 
transmission still sit on the chassis.&nbsp; Sometimes axles and struts, radiators 
and condensers are included.&nbsp; Sheet metal is never included, but sometime are 
left on the clip.&nbsp; Shipping across the country can cost as much as $1000+&nbsp; 
Prices are quoted depending on what is minimally included.&nbsp; Example MR2 rear 
clip</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: blue">CONVERSION 
PACKAGE-</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp; engine with 
harness, engine accessories, afm or map sensor, ecu.&nbsp;&nbsp; Depending on the engine, 
sometimes the original engine accessories and some electrical components&nbsp; 
(coil/igniter, afm or map sensor) are reusable- so the packages may be slightly 
different.&nbsp; Prices are quoted depending on what is minimally included.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
example: 3SGE to 3SGTE</span></p>
<h1><font face="Arial">
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: blue; font-weight: normal">ENGINE UPGRADE 
/ REPLACEMENT PACKAGE-</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-weight: normal">&nbsp; 
engine with manifolds; no accessories (alternator, power-steering pump, AC 
compressor; normally this is ordered to replace the same or similar engine.&nbsp; 
Some electrical parts (distributor, coil packs, sensors) are usually left with 
the engine, but are not part of what you paid for.&nbsp; <br>
example:&nbsp; 5MG to 6MG upgrades</span></font></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: blue">LONG BLOCK 
ENGINE-</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp; engine with 
cylinder head and block- valve cover to oil pan.&nbsp; No manifolds.&nbsp; All internal 
parts are as installed on the head and block.&nbsp; Your original manifolds may work 
with slight modification.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: blue">SHORT BLOCK-</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
this will be the engine block only, with crankshaft and pistons;&nbsp; Japanese 
blocks will interchange with U.S. blocks with no problem;&nbsp; if you intend to use 
as a street engine use this with your original U.S. head and emission controls; 
these blocks are usually updated versions.&nbsp; example: hi-compression 4AGE to U.S 
4AGE</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: red">NOTE:</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp; 
Most engines we sell are Japanese specification and some where never imported 
into the U.S.&nbsp;Most do not have EGR provisions, some can be retrofitted, some 
cannot;&nbsp; Although most engines will pass a tailpipe test, they are not legal for 
U.S. certification without an EGR retrofit.&nbsp; Toysport imports and sells Japanese 
specification engines for competition use only.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial">Expect 
to change all tune-up related parts- sparkplugs, distributor wire/cap/rotor; 
thermostat; timing/fan belts; water pump.&nbsp;&nbsp; For high performance engines 
changing rings and head-gasket is recommended, but most engines are used 
“as-is”. On older model engines and turbo models reconditioning is highly 
recommended.&nbsp; There is no warranty on all used high performance engines.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
