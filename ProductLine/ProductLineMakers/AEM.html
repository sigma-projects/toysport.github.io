      Engine Management) is a company based on one simple philosophy....If it
      doesn't create horsepower, AEM won't make it. As the import performance
      market gained popularity, AEM added to this philosophy: &quot;If it
      doesn't out perform our competition, we won't make it.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Horsepower is how AEM's reputation was built. Long before it was the
      popular thing to do, AEM was discovering ways to maximize the performance
      of Honda, Toyota and Mitsubishi cars. Through this history of experience
      AEM has come to the firm belief to let AEM products do the talking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>AEM research and development is staffed with accredited engineering
      professionals. This insures that every AEM product is developed and
      correctly engineered for each specific application.<br>
      <br>
      All AEM products are put to demanding tests in their own dyno facility as
      well as on the track and in real-world conditions. Never shy from
      challenge, every major compact car publication has put AEM products to
      their own reviews. Each magazine has reached the same results: AEM
      products improve performance, increase power and help better realize the
      full potential of compact car engines and brakes....no brag, just fact.<o:p>
