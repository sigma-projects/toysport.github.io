<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Evolution is defined as
&quot;A gradual process in which something changes into a different and usually
better or more complex form.&quot; This concept perfectly describes the
development of Brembo's High-Performance Brake Kits. The knowledge gained
through making the world's best original equipment and competition brake system
components has been combined to create the best available high-performance
braking systems.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Brembo High-Performance
Brake Kits include 12- to 14-inch cross-drilled cadmium-plated rotors. These are
the same rotors that are used on numerous championship-winning racecars. Billet
aluminum hats are vehicle specific and have been machined to exacting
specifications. The hats and rotors combine to create a &quot;floating&quot;
disc which improves brake performance, pedal feel and heat related stress<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Brembo's aluminum
four-piston calipers utilize sequentially sized pistons to reduce tapered wear
of the included high-performance brake pads. These calipers are mounted with
specially machined billet brackets. The vehicle's hydraulic system is connected
to the calipers with Goodridge brand DOT and TÜV approved stainless steel
braided brake lines.<o:p>

mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:JA;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">The
extensive brake system knowledge gained by Brembo engineers over the past 38
years allows us to produce big brake kits that provide superior braking
performance while maintaining the reliability required in a street vehicle. And,
while their design focuses o function rather than form, they look great,
especially with today's plus-sized open-design wheels.<br>
<br>
The process of developing Brembo's High Performance Brake Kits has been a
gradual one, and the result is definitely a better and more complex form of
brake system.<br>
