<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">In the middle of Europe - in the heart of Germany - lies the
delightful central mountain region called &quot;Sauerland&quot;.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">The Sauerland, which is a part of Westphalia and is also
referred to as the land of the thousand mountains.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It has been known for centuries for its production of iron
and for steel processing. Virtues and abilities relating to crafts are values
that continue to be held in high esteem today and are the pride and tradition of
many Sauerland families.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">This was the cradle of Eibach. This is where Heinrich Eibach
started his production of single springs on a purely handcrafted basis in a tiny
hut almost 50 years ago. He was a learned spring maker and already had decades
of experience. His passion for the product, for innovative production
technology, as well as his commitment to highest quality workmanship is the
elixir of the Eibach Group today.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Until the 70's, Eibach produced springs for industrial
applications exclusively. It was not until the formation of the German
Tuning-Industry that Eibach became the sought-after partner for chassis springs
production.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Today, Eibach is the worldwide leader of high quality chassis
technology. They are also involved in Industrial Springs, Dynaflex Die-Springs
and Seal Components, High Performance Valve Springs, Children's Playground
Components and more.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">In addition to the ultra modern parent plant in Finnentrop,
Germany, there is a similar facility in Irvine, California.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Eibach first moved beyond the Sauerland with the development and
production of high-quality racing shocks in Great Britain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Now Eibach is represented by Engineering and Marketing firms in Japan and
Australia and is also represented by exclusive importers in about 50 other
countries.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Today, as in the past, Eibach is a family owned and operated
company; now in the second and third generation. Its style remains unchanged –
Eibach is committed to products with its heart and its intellect. Eibach’s
strength is in providing market and customer-specific solutions by collaborating
with our partners through simultaneous Engineering.<o:p>

<h1><b><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">The Eibach Philosophy<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></b></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">For almost 5 decades, the entire Eibach Team, including all
employees, has worked within a special culture in our relations with customers,
vendors and other partners leading Eibach to today's global position. This
internal culture comes from the heart of all our employees and is not
artificially created. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Two years ago, Eibach began to associate the words Tension
& Balance - as physical elements - to their company Philosophy. They
transformed this perceived identity into a visual image as it relates to all
aspects of their business. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Eibach’s philosophy starts with the relationship between
Owners, Management and the Employees. This relationship is the main element of
their entire company culture. Eibach feels that these relationships are balanced
by unconditional mutual respect, fairness, honesty and loyalty - it is quite
simply, the mutual care for each other’s well being. These mutual
relationships can't be split into classes or groups. This means all Eibach’s
business partners - on the premises of their loyalty - can expect from Eibach a
behavior influenced by this Balance. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">This is the one element of Eibach’s culture we are most
proud of and work diligently to maintain. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">However, this element alone is not able to move mountains –
we, as well as Eibach, need the kick, the excitement and most of all, the
passion. This means constantly setting goals and monitoring tasks in order to
reach these goals. This is where Tension comes into play. Tension is symbolized
by the excitement, drive, and passion to develop new products or open new
markets, to obtain even higher quality levels, to enjoy the mutual success in
motorsports, etc., etc., etc. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">This Tension can only be balanced with TeamWork and Team
Spirit, which grows stronger with new challenges.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Only within such a positive sphere of Balanced Tension, can
one realize the joy of personal performance which in turn positively effects the
mental attitude releasing personal power to excel in one's work. <o:p>
