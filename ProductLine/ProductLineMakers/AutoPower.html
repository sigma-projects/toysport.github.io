sports car/racing equipment and the first roll bar manufacturer to be licensed
and certified by the Sports Car Club of America. High standards of workmanship
go into every Autopower product. All roll bars and cages are precision machined
and MIG welded. Roll cage kits can be added to the majority of the vehicles,
these are designed to fit each individual car model and is not a universal kit.
All bolts, nuts and back-up plates are included. Most tubing size is 1 3/4&quot;
x .120 unless noted otherwise. The sedan roll bars is distinctively styled to
match the contour of the car for which it is designed for. All feature 4 point
mounting for safety and chassis stiffening. The racing bar has a diagonal cross
bar plus a head restraint. An optional roll bar cover is also available, it is
designed to enhance the appearance of the roll bar and to provide safety in
padding the roll bar against casual contact. <o:p>
