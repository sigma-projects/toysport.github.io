& N offers over 1000 stock replacement applications, hundreds of universal
clamp-on filters and dozens of Filtercharger Injection Performance Kits. Their
goal is to provide the highest quality component at a competitive price. A
K&N Filtercharger will be the last filter you will ever buy for your car,
truck, motorhome, motorcycle, ATV, boat or jet ski - Guaranteed. <o:p>

<p><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font size="2">The
primary function of an air filter is to clean the air before it enters the
engine. If this is true, why do we see so many engines, especially expensive
competition engines, without air filters? The answer is airflow. An engine's
power output is proportional to the volume of air it can ingest at any given
rpm, assuming the fuel management system is capable of sustaining a near perfect
air/fuel mixture ratio. The most minute restriction in the air induction system
will cause an engine's optimum power output to drop. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font size="2">Maintaining
optimum, unrestricted flow becomes a problem when the air must pass through a
filter element. Conventional paper elements are very resistant to air flow
because the filter material or medium is very dense. The greater the restriction
the greater the power loss. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font size="2">K&N
engineers have made vast improvements in performance, durability and
serviceability by directly addressing these inherent compromises. In the early
'60s, K&N developed an oil impregnated cotton air filter gauze which exceeds
the minimum filtration standards while offering little restriction to air flow.
As a result, the first K&N filter element was manufactured by sandwiching
several layers of surgical gauze between two sheets of wire mesh. The medium was
then pleated to reduce the filter's overall size and to increase its surface
area. Finally the cotton gauze was oiled to enhance it's filtering capabilities.
The original concept exists today and remains the basic component used in all of
our automotive, industrial, marine and motorcycle air filters. <o:p>

<p><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font size="2">K&N's
oil-impregnated, cotton-gauze element is the basis of our filter, as well as
K&N's overall dominance of the reusable air filter market. The process is
expensive but well worth the effort. To further make the point, consider that
square inch per square inch, our filter will flow an average of 50 percent more
air compared to the average paper filter without sacrificing filtration
efficiency. <o:p>

</span></span></font></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font size="2">By
comparison, paper filters are made from compressed fibers. The spaces between
these fibers provide microscopic holes the air must pass through. One by one,
these holes become plugged with dirt and dust particles. Once a hole becomes
plugged, the air must find an alternate route through the medium. As the filter
collects more dirt, its resistance to air flow increases because there are fewer
and fewer holes left open and as restriction goes up, horsepower and fuel
economy go down. But to meet minimum filtration standards, the paper must be
thick and/or the fibers must be tightly compressed and dense. Therefore paper
elements that provide adequate filtration are restrictive to air flow by design.
Any paper element that could flow as much air as an equivalent K&N would not
provide safe filtration. Additionally, as a paper filter becomes more and more
clogged, the pressure inside the filter drops while the atmospheric air pressure
(approximately 14.6 psig at sea level) outside the filter remains the same. It's
like using your lungs to draw the air out of a plastic milk bottle. When the
pressure differential becomes too great, the bottle will collapse. The same
thing could happen to your paper filter, although it is unlikely. But what will
happen could be just as severe. An excessively high pressure differential
created by a restricted filter can literally pull dirt particles through the
paper medium. In other words, the performance of a paper filter, i.e. air flow
through the filter and its ability to protect your engine, DECREASES near the
end of its service interval. </font><o:p>
