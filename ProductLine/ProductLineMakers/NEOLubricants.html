genuine ..concern regarding the limitations of ..existing oil products, Paul
Baker has ..developed the NEO SYNTHETIC OIL ..COMPANY to meet the ever changing
..needs of the automotive industry.</span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></b></span></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><b><span style="font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Back in the 80's, even the major oil ..companies held the
philosophy that ..in ..order to improve an oil product's performance, they
needed to thicken the product. Paul realized that what was needed was a stronger
product - not necessarily a heavier product - thicker was not better ! He
decided to take his existing oil and experiment with some of the additives
available at that time. </span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></b></span></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><b><span style="font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">To his satisfaction, he began to see improvement,
strengthening his belief that thinner oils were the key. Following his
introduction to the synthetic oils being experimented with in the military, Paul
saw a new direction in the development of synthetic oil for racing and
automotive applications - thus NEO SYNTHETIC OIL was born</span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><o:p>

</span></b></span></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><b><span style="font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Success in motorsports has been a major part of NEO's
history, and is certain to be a major part of its future. The 2-cycle oil NEO
developed for Mercury Marine helped bring Betty Cook her two world
championships. NEO has also helped set land speed records - including the
fastest Harley Davidson (set at Bonneville). NEO helped Dale Armstrong engines
set their hall of fame records. Over 50% of the European Formula 1 cars use some
type of NEO product, and NEO helped the Draco team win two GM Lotus Euro Series
Championships. By 1987, every Indy Car that ran a March Engineering Gear Box at
Indy used the gear oils and CV joint lubrications developed by NEO.</span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><o:p>

<p><font size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><b><span style="font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">A major breakthrough for NEO came in the late '80's with the
development of the &quot;0&quot; weight lubrication. A tribute to the value of
this oil comes from the owners and drivers of the engines using this oil who
state their engines look better after running this &quot;0&quot; weight oil than
prior to doing so, and &quot;0&quot; weight helped Formula Ford win the Canadian
Championship !</span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:

<p><font size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><b><span style="font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">And now, as we approach the 21st century, NEO is proud to be
the official and only lubricant recommended by X-Trac for all their gearboxes
and was used by 8 out of the top ten finishers at Lemans in 1999.</span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><o:p>

</span></b></span></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><b><span style="font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The future of NEO holds unlimited possibilities in the
development of all types of synthetic lubrication. Products to watch include the
CV joint grease as used by the Williams' Formula I Team and the wheel bearing
grease currently being tested by both Jaguar and Williams. NEO.is working on a
gear box oil for use behind the 6OO - 7OOHP engines currently being run in
European&nbsp; GT racing. BMW is only one of the many companies looking at NEO
products for use in their racing vehicles...Long term, NEO hopes to develop a
product for engines involved in the greater horsepower - longer duration races.</span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><o:p>

be involved with leaders in the industry, so you can be assured that when a new
lubricant is needed, NEO will be in the forefront of its development.</span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><o:p>
