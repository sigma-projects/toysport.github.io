&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Clutch Masters has been in business for over twenty three
years. Since conception, Clutch Masters has remained specialized in the clutch
field with product covering new and re-manufactured units for Automobile, Truck,
Industrial and Exotic. We contribute the continued successful growth of our
company to the combination of superior quality, technical support and product
availability at competitive prices. We believe that these attributes contribute
to our desire to remain specialized in our industry, unlike many of our
contributors who in the past years have found it necessary to venture into other
product lines to retain market penetration.</span><span style="font-family:

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">A clutch is a mechanical friction device designed to
gradually lock and transmit the torque developed by the engine to the gearbox.
The clutch does not make horsepower, it transmits the power. When the clutch is
released, the transmission spins free and enable gear selection.</span><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The strength of the clutch is determined by the torque of
the engine and the weight of the vehicle. (Clutch Balance)</span><span style="font-family:

</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">If you increase the torque of an engine or add weight to
the vehicle, you are most likely to experience premature clutch failure.

</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Torque and Clutch Capacity have a mathematical value.
Proper clutch balance is achieved when Clutch Capacity = Torque.</span><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
