<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2"><b>Carrillo
Industries got its start in 1963 when Fred Carrillo saw a need for dependable,
high quality connecting rods for the high-performance racing industry. Many
parts of the internal combustion engine are susceptible to failure, but one of
the most susceptible is the connecting rod. The connecting rod transfers energy
from the engine, to the crankshaft, and ultimately to the final drive
mechanisms. A failed connecting rod can result in a lost race and the potential
destruction of a very expensive piece of machinery. Since the conception of the
connecting rod business,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Carrillo
Industries have been dedicated to precision and quality construction. Their
design goal for every rod made to maximize strength and durability while
minimizing weight. Carrillo's experience with engines is based on several
decades of active participation in competition with motorcycles, dragsters,
straight-aways and predominantly championship cars. Combining aerospace
background with years of experience in competitive racing, to design and
manufacture the most durable and long-lasting connecting rod<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Carillo products endure even the most severe conditions produced during
high performance competition. <o:p>
</o:p>
</b></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2"><b>Fatigue
is the major cause of connecting rod failure. At Carrillo Industries,
proprietary steel, manufactured and forged to custom specifications are used.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>After experimenting with virtually every other reasonable material, this
chromium / nickel / vanadium / molybdenum FORGED alloy is used exclusively to
meet stringent requirements for strength and durability.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Carillo connecting rods are fully machined to guarantee the removal of
all surface imperfections in the forging. After heat treatment, each connecting
rod is 100% magnaflux inspected and hardness checked, then machined to final
size. Each set of rods is balanced and then shot peened to achieve the ultimate
in strength and fatigue properties. <o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2"><b>One of
the most susceptible points of failure in conventionally designed connecting
rods is the fastener system. At Carrillo, a great deal of effort is excerted
into developing rod bolts for specific applications. This effort has led to the
utilization of four different bolt designs. The largest bolt available is a 7/16
inch diameter thread, fabricated either from AISI H11 tool steel or Multiphase<sup>®</sup>
material. Many questions are directed regarding proper bolt selection. Briefly,
the H11 bolt (WMC7 and WMC6) is a high quality, aircraft standard fastener,
applicable to most high performance uses. Under racing conditions, we suggest
that the H11 bolts be changed periodically. In comparison, the Multiphase<sup>®</sup>
bolt (SPS-CARR) is designed to be a non-replacement type fastener. </b></font><o:p>
