      did HKS become the leader in the import performance world?<br>
      In 1973, Mr. Hasegawa and his partner, Mr. Kitagawa, designed the first
      commercialized turbocharger for passenger cars.&nbsp; Joining forces with
      Sigma Company (hence the designation HKS), they built and marketed their
      product and have never looked back.<br>
      <br>
      Fast forward 26 years, and you see that HKS has become an international
      leader in the performance aftermarket industry.&nbsp; Establishing HKS
      USA, Inc. in 1986, HKS reaffirmed its commitment to customer service and
      quality products to consumers in North and South America.<br>
      <br>
      And today, the aftermarket industry is quickly filling with start-up
      companies following in HKS footsteps.&nbsp; None however, benefit from the
      engineering or manufacturing resources available to the highly motivated
      and dedicated employees (true car enthusiasts) of HKS.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      HKS has become synonymous with winning in the import performance world, as
      demonstrated by its quickly expanding and ever-loyal customer base
      worldwide.&nbsp; The reason?&nbsp; Simple:&nbsp; Whether it is engine,
      suspension, or drivetrain components, there is NO substitute for the
      quality and reliability of HKS Performance Products. <o:p>
