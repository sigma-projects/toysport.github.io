<p align="left">With over 30 years of experience and nearly 1,700 products, Moroso 
  is your one-stop performance source for Drag and Oval Track Racing, Street Machines, 
  and Show Cars. Our race-proven products are designed and manufactured with a 
  formidable combination of computer-controlled equipment, quality materials, 
  and expert craftsmanship. <o:p> </o:p><o:p></o:p> </p>
<p align="left">As a leader in innovation, Moroso has developed many products 
  that have become commonplace in racing today such as deep sump oil pans, tall 
  valve covers, electric water pumps, solid motor mounts, and many more. This 
  innovative tradition continues as Moroso engineers continually develop new products 
  through our close working relationship with the nation's top engine builders 
  and race teams. Extensive research and development, on-track testing, and a 
  steadfast commitment to quality are the cornerstones on which Moroso has earned 
  its reputation for over three decades.<o:p> </o:p><o:p></o:p> </p>
<p align="left">Moroso Performance Products is one of the worlds most respected 
  suppliers of automotive equipment for racing and street performance applications. 
  Moroso manufacturers nearly 1700 products, from oil pans and oiling system accessories, 
  to valve covers, ignition components, fuel system equipment, air cleaners, hard 
  core racing tools and numerous other performance parts. The company has an impressive 
  list of customers, ranging from grass-roots racers to top level NASCAR Winston 
  Cup and NHRA/IHRA race teams. In addition to the Connecticut based manufacturing 
  operation, the company also owns Moroso Motorsports Park located in West Palm 
  Beach, Florida. This is a multi-use facility including a 2.25 mile, ten turn 
  road course and a state-of-the-art NHRA sanctioned drag strip.<o:p> </o:p><o:p></o:p> 
</p>
<p align="left">Moroso was started in 1968 by Dick Moroso, one of the most successful 
  modified production drag racers on record. Dick left his racing career to design, 
  test and manufacture specialized products aimed exclusively at racer's needs. 
  Racers quickly recognized that Moroso products were a cut above the others because 
  they were designed and built for racers - by racers!<o:p> </o:p><o:p></o:p> 
</p>
<p align="left">Dick Moroso was responsible for many innovations in the high performance 
  industry. He was instrumental in nurturing the warehouse distribution (WD) network, 
  which became an integral step in supplying the growing number of speed shops 
  appearing in every corner of the country. In addition, Moroso pioneered several 
  racing products including deep-sump oil pans, electric water pumps, tall valve 
  covers, lightweight front drag tires, racing vacuum pumps, and others.<o:p> 
  </o:p><o:p></o:p> </p>
<p align="left">In November 1998, while the company was celebrating its 30th anniversary, 
  Dick Moroso lost a year-long battle with cancer.<o:p> </o:p><o:p> </o:p> </p>
<p align="left">The Moroso tradition of innovation, quality and integrity is carried 
  forward by his son Rick, who in 1997 was named president of Moroso Performance 
  Products. Rick also carries on the Moroso drag racing legacy, campaigning the 
  seriously updated 1961 Corvette that his dad raced during the 60's.<o:p> </o:p><o:p></o:p> 
</p>
<p align="left">The Moroso heritage also continues in manufacturing and quality 
  control. Computer systems with the latest CAD/CAM software have replaced the 
  drafting tables and the Moroso plant is now filled with sophisticated CNC machinery 
  including turret punch presses, turning centers, lathes and robotic welders. 
  The combination of highly skilled craftsmen and highly accurate machinery guarantees 
  that the tradition of quality started by Dick Moroso over 30 years ago will 
  continue throughout the coming decades.<o:p> </o:p><o:p></o:p> </p>
<p align="left"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">As 
  Morosp looks forward to the future you can count on Moroso's continued commitment 
  to quality, technical support and racing. We have renewed our long-standing 
  contingency relationship with NASCAR, NHRA and IHRA, and have made new commitments 
  to other sanctioning bodies such as the Contingency Connection, IMCA, NMCA and 
  NIRA.</span>
