mounted in front of the radiator. A custom heat shield protects
other components under the hood. The clutch is a Centerforce Dual

Convertible</strong> <br>
</font><font face="Arial">
The 7MGTE transplant into this RA60 Celica was done to showcase
Toysport tuning and convertion capability. The 7MGTE was bored
out to 3100cc using forged Toysport pistons and an HKS Metal
Headgasket.. A modified oil pan and pump were fabricated to
install the engine in the &quot;short&quot; chassis. The head
received minor port clean-up and all manifolds were EXTRUDE
HONED. An HKS TwinTurbo manifold was used using twin TURBONETICS
prepared T2.5/T3s. A four-row HKS Intercooler with a three row
custom radiator were fitted to handle all the cooling. The car
was rewired using 7MGTE electronics, supplemented by an HKS F-Con
controlling HKS 550cc. injectors, HKS VPC, HKS EVC, and HKS SBV.
The exhaust used modified HKS 3&quot; exhaust. Front custom
sway-bars were made by SWAY AWAY, who also supplied the rear bar.
Tokico Sport Springs and Illumina 5-way adjustable shocks
complete the suspension. To keep the sutble enhanced look-
projector lights were built-in the corner/signal lights; the
front bumper was ventilated for the turbo intercooler; to
complete the up-dated performance look- Recaro C seats in gray
leather and SSR Racing Wheels 16x8 and 16x9 with 225/285Pirelli
tires were added. Featured in the 1994 February issue of CARBOY,
a Japanese published Automobile Magazine. Also appeared in the
1992 July issue of TURBO MAGAZINE.<br>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>TOYOTA 7MGTE TURBO TRUCK </strong><br>
BEEN THERE, DONE THAT. For many years this black Toyota 4X4 kept
getting re-incarnated. Finally Supra turbo power- ended the
search. A quick review- Mikunis/Cam/Headers- BEEN THERE.
Toysport-spec SCORE/HDRA engine- BEEN THERE. Supercharger /forged
pistons- BEEN THERE. Exit 22R. Final edition- 7MGTE with full
automatic 4X4 transmission and transfer case. A modified torque
converter was installed with the HKS Automatic transmission
upgrade, to handle the potent power source and maintain 4WD
characteristics. The modified 7MGTE with full electronics from a
Supra was shoehorned into the engine compartment. A full HKS
Stage 6 conversion made the work a little easier for 439 HP. This
conversion was completed with HD radiator, twin-electric fans, 2
row intercooler, oil cooler, transmission cooler, differential
coolers (to cool everything down) and of course air-conditioner
(a must keep, that caused a lot of problems) to cool the driver.
The only non-Toyota part was the 9&quot; Ford rear end that still
kept breaking!!! Four wheel burn-outs were unbelievable and
impressive- for a 4WD Toyota. A full Rancho suspension with ARB
lockers was also installed, with reinforced suspension mounts,
stiffened axle housings, and custom driveshaft. This truck was
used for all it had! RECARO seats and a full SIMPSON harness were
the only interior option. Before Ivan Stewart got his V8- this
was the fastest Toyota powered Truck. As seen on the January 1991
issue of Four Wheeler Magazine- &quot;this was the fastest Toyota
Truck we ever tested&quot;. DONE.</font></p>
