<h1><span style="color: blue"><font size="4">LEXUS- The Pursuit Analyzed</font></span></h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>A Background</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">The 1989 LS400 was 
Toyota’s definitive statement to the automobile world- on what a Luxury car 
should be.&nbsp; Even before Lexus had a corporate name, the other car manufacturers 
and automobile press anxiously awaited the product.&nbsp; They wanted to see how 
Toyota was going to enter the Luxury Import field. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Most people were not aware 
that Toyota had a history and experience in building luxury cars.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">In Japan, </span>
<span style="font-family: Arial">Toyota</span><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
has been selling luxury vehicles all along.&nbsp; The Toyota Crown series had 
undergone several generations of refinement, incorporating luxury features that 
were considered de rigueur for luxury automobiles.&nbsp; Add to these, options that 
were unheard of and unavailable from other manufacturers- ice box, extended 
chassis, oscillating vents, parking assist, and numerous gadgets thoughtfully 
Japanese, that had no place or were unavailable in American or European luxury 
models.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Very few were even aware 
of the Toyota Century.&nbsp; A car fit for Japanese nobility (as the Rolls-Royce was 
for the British Aristocracy), for Statesmen (as Mercedes was for Presidents, and 
dictators.), or Captains of industry (as all other Luxury car manufacturers try 
to cater to).&nbsp; This car was not sold to anybody/everybody- you had to wait for a
</span><span style="font-family: Arial">Toyota</span><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
invitation.&nbsp; Buyers had to be acceptable to Toyota!&nbsp; Imagine a fully optioned 
Mercedes S-class with the limited availability of a Rolls-Royce Phantom- that 
was the Century.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">There is no car 
manufacturer with the model range Toyota has.&nbsp; And for Toyota, Lexus was more a 
marketing exercise rather than a new manufacturing attempt. The brand name Lexus 
has become part of automobile history.&nbsp; The LS400 has joined the Toyota 2000GT 
and Toyota Corolla as Toyota’s 3rd Milestone car- important car models in the 
evolution of the Motor Car. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">When the first LS was 
introduced, the competitive cars targeted were the Jaguar XJ, the Cadillac 
Fleetwood, and the S-class (mid-model 420SEL).&nbsp; Toyota made sure in more than 
180 measurable test parameters that the LS was better. From exhaust note, to 
wood finish, to suspension dampening, to mechanical vibrations, and even AC fan 
blower noise- all aspects were covered and srpassed.&nbsp; testing was done from 
California&nbsp; to Florida, a northern route East and southern route West. &nbsp;&nbsp;(Toyota
</span><span style="font-family: Arial">Technical</span><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
Center even borrowed our Toyota Soarer).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Toyota diehards had an 
uneasy feeling when the LS400 and the Infiniti Q45 were introduced.&nbsp; The Lexus 
U.S. Flagship was short in specifications when compared to the Q45.&nbsp; Despite the 
initial stir with the automobile press and technical specification junkies- 
Lexus still delivered the Right Product. Of course Nissan fumbled- and Lexus 
marketing took off.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Lexus was primarily 
targeted at Mercedes.&nbsp; In the ensuing years, the LS caused Mercedes to downspec 
the S-class (and its complete model line) to reduce the price differences and 
meet the value aspect.&nbsp; Even the new 3<sup>rd</sup> generation LS 430, continued 
to play its hero role as the underdog, by not trying to outdo Mercedes feature 
for feature in the current S-class.&nbsp; An S-Class killer, Lexus could easily have 
produced but Lexus remains the master in marketing- why be the top dog from 
which the only way is down?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Mercedes has had to raise 
the standard with the Maybach project.&nbsp; But then again remember that the current 
generation Toyota Century awaits it’s global introduction with the V12 engine 
and other options that Mercedes has not used in their current production cars.&nbsp; 
The ULTIMATE Lexus is still a Toyota.&nbsp; Toyota has that angle easily covered.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">The creation of the Lexus 
Divison of Toyota has succeeded in building a very loyal and inspired customer 
base.&nbsp; And what happens when you get some people excited?&nbsp; You soon have a 
race.&nbsp; </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">The Future</span></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">All great car brands have 
to excel in Motorsports.&nbsp; Rolls Royce, Bentley, Buggati, Mercedes….all had to 
prove mechanical superiority to the motor world.&nbsp; Lexus sights are now set on 
PERFORMANCE. The arrival of the U.S. IS 300 is the first effort.&nbsp; For once the 
U.S. gets the best model of the IS, all other markets have the 2000cc versions.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">The awaited entry of Lexus 
in this marketing niche, with BMW M models and Mercedes AMG versions as the 
definitive models to emulate- has Lexus owners in a state of frenzy.&nbsp; They know 
that there are available versions of the Lexus models that can out-perform BMW M 
series and Mercedes AMG, or come very close.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Lexus corporate is 
examining this new niche with the same caution and marketing research that 
outplayed Acura and Infiniti; gained parity with the European Marques with one 
model- the LS 400.&nbsp; Lexus.&nbsp;&nbsp; Delivering the Right Product at the Right Time has 
always been the Lexus hallmark. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">For all the investment and 
goodwill Lexus has structured in its image and marketing, they are 
ultra-conservative in preserving the stature and market position of their 
product line. The products are available, but the market has to wait. It is a 
matter of time. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">With Toyota entering F1 
and with a new Motorsport Marketing Division established (in Japan)- new and 
exciting cars are in the pipeline.&nbsp; A real Grand Touring Supra, a real 
Performance Luxury Sedan, our dreams are closer to reality….</span></p>
<h1>In The Meantime</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">The Lexus GS and IS base 
models are the perfect building blocks.&nbsp; Behind a different grille logo and with 
different Toyota trunk emblems- Aristo and Altezza, the sporty models are 
available and waiting off-shore.&nbsp; Toyota in Japan has all the hardware for Lexus 
models to go heads-up against BMW and Mercedes.&nbsp; Japanese tuners have hardware 
to surpass model for model, the vaunted BMW M division and all of AMG combined.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">(Those who cannot wait, it 
has to be done behind the </span><span style="font-family: Arial">Toyota</span><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
badge. Many are ready to switch badges and do to Lexus models what they had been 
doing with their Corollas, Celicas, MR2s, and Supras ……. or Lexus will take your 
L-car away.)</span></p>
