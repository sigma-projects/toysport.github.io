<font face="Arial"><p><span style="font-family:Arial">G-TECH/Pro is an electronic Performance Meter 
  for automobiles. It's designed to make a professional test driver out of anybody. 
  All you have to do is plug it in a cigarette lighter, mount it to the windshield 
  and start accelerating. G-TECH/Pro does the rest automatically and displays 
  the results. It's a great way to get performance and safety information about 
  you car for only <b>$139.95!<o:p> </o:p> </b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">We are very proud of the all new G-TECH/Pro. 
  The responses to the Pro have been phenomenal. Magazines are raving about it. 
  Customers are loving it. New Digital Signal Processing algorithms coupled with 
  Gold Plated Circuitry and a Precision Silicon Accelerometer insure impeccable 
  accuracy. Best of all, we still have the old price.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:Arial">What can it do?<o:p> </o:p> </span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">G-TECH/Pro takes advantage of many different 
  measurements that can be gathered from acceleration over time. For Horsepower 
  measurement the user has to input the weight of the vehicle. We utilize what 
  we call &quot;Intuitive User Interface&quot;. To input weight all you have to 
  do is simply tilt G-TECH/Pro up and the numbers will increase and if you tilt 
  it down the numbers will decrease. Further you tilt it faster the numbers change.<br>
  <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><br>
  In Horsepower mode G-TECH/Pro will display currently delivered horsepower during 
  acceleration and then when you slow down it will display maximum delivered horsepower.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>All the measurements are performed automatically. All you have to do 
  is push the button indicating to G-TECH/Pro that you are ready and then G-TECH/Pro 
  will zero-out and display -GO-. Then simply start accelerating. G-TECH/Pro will 
  know your speed and distance at any given moment and stop the measurement at 
  60 mph or 1/4 mile point.<br>
  <br>
  While measuring Lateral or Longitudinal G's user has the choice of Instantaneous 
  or Continuous mode. Instantaneous G's are great for analyzing when tires lost 
  traction during braking and cornering or measuring any other kind of G-load. 
  Continuous G's are designed for standard Skidpad handling measurements of Lateral 
  G's.<br>
  <br>
  When measuring Braking distance in feet user doesn't have to start braking exactly 
  at 60 mph. G-TECH/Pro knows the speed always and it will only measure distance 
  from 60-0 mph even if you started braking at 65 mph for example.<o:p> </o:p> 
  </span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;<o:p> </o:p> </span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:Arial">How does it work?<o:p> </o:p> </span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The 
  heart of the G-TECH/Pro is a precision silicon accelerometer. An accelerometer 
  is a sensor that measures acceleration, also known as G-Force. G-Force is what's 
  keeping you in your seat as you are reading these words and if it wasn't for 
  the seat you would be accelerating to the ground at 1G (32 feet per second per 
  second).<br>
  <br>
  G-TECH/Pro measures your speed and distance traveled by integrating acceleration 
  over time. Basically, if you know how fast you are accelerating for a certain 
  time period you'll know how much your speed has changed after that time period. 
  So, if you start of from zero speed then you'll know what your speed is after 
  every time period. These time periods are very small (2.5 milliseconds) and 
  that's how G-TECH/Pro maintains its accuracy.<br>
  <br>
  Distance is measured in the same fashion, if you know how fast you are going 
  for a certain time period you will know what is the distance traveled during 
  that time period.<br>
  <br>
  G-TECH/Pro also measures delivered Horsepower, sometimes called Rear Wheel Horsepower. 
  This horsepower includes the loss of power through the drivetrain which is usually 
  10-15%. The formula for Horsepower is speed times acceleration times the weight 
  of the vehicle.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">What 
  about accuracy?<o:p> </o:p> </span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The 
  best way to look at accuracy is in two different ways. <b>Resolution </b>is 
  the smallest segment of a given measurement that G-TECH/Pro can sense. <b>Real 
  Life accuracy</b> is the worst case scenario to be expected in your measurements.<br>
  The difference between <b>Resolution</b> and <b>Real Life accuracy</b> is the 
  result of noise, temperature dependency, vibration and other elements that influence 
  the accelerometer and other internal electronic circuitry. <o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Our 
  accelerometer is one of the best in the world. It starts out as a 1/8 inch silicone 
  cube. Then it's laser sliced in to a sandwich with the critical mass in the 
  middle. It sits in the specially designed silicone gel with dampening characteristics 
  tailored for automotive dynamics. On top of all this there is a special accelerometer 
  enclosure with grounded metal layer for EMI shielding.<br>
  We at TESLA Electronics believe that the best way to insure accuracy is to get 
  a good, clean signal from the outside world and that's why the accelerometer 
  in the G-TECH/Pro costs more than all other parts put together.<o:p> </o:p>

<p><b><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">What's 
  the maximum G range of the G-TECH/Pro?</span></b><span style="font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><br>
  <br>
  In order to achieve such high accuracy Maximum G range of G-TECH/Pro is ~1.3 
  G's. This is fine for all the cars who's 1/4 mile E.T.'s are above <b>7 seconds</b>. 
  If you have a car that's below 7 seconds you may experience inaccurate measurements 
  due to clipping. Clipping is when the amount of G-Forces exceeds the limits 
  of G-TECH/Pro. This can't hurt G-TECH/Pro but it can upset the measurements. 
  Clipping will manifest itself by longer times than expected.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Can G-TECH/Pro be used on motorcycles?</b><br>
  <br>
  This question is somewhat related to the one above. Some motorcycles deliver 
  G's that exced 1.3 G range. G-TECH/Pro wasn't designed for use with motorcycles. 
  However, some customers have used it with motorcycles with success. It's very 
  hard to say what G's (and for how long) can your motorcycle deliver even if 
  you know it's E.T.'s. In this case our Risk Free Money Back Guarantee can come 
  in handy.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Why is my G-TECH/Pro consistently 2-3 mph above the track?<br>
  </b><br>
  G-TECH/Pro is a very accurate machine, and the trap speed result that you get 
  from the G-TECH/Pro is actually more accurate than the racetrack. Reason is 
  that the racetrack averages your speed over a 60 feet stretch between two beams 
  and G-TECH/Pro measures your speed at the exact 1/4 mile point.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>How do I update my regular G-TECH to G-TECH/Pro?<br>
  <br>
  </b>All you have to do is send your G-TECH to TESLA Electronics, Accu-Sembly 
  Inc., 4123 Rowland Ave. El Monte, CA 91731 and include a note with your address 
  and a $40 payment (includes shipping) and we will take care of the rest.<o:p>
