<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>The 3SG was introduced in 1986. This engine
series was initially available in a FWD, AWD, or mid-ship configuration.
Transverse. The block is based on the S series engines- a lightweight steel
block that was earlier used with SOHC heads. Again this is an evolutionary
engine. The 16-valve design is very similar to the 4AG and 7MG, in fact valves,
springs, lifters- are very close dimensionally. The head is of the G type,
meaning it was designed as the performance model as compared to the F types that
are designed for torque and low-end response. Our concern here is performance so
we will discuss only the G models.</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>There are 4 distinct generations. The 1st
generation, most common in the US, is TVIS inducted (dual-runners with large
ports) available in NA or Turbo editions. The 2nd generation was also
available in both NA and Turbo forms, but had a different intake system (and
smaller ports). The old TVIS system was replaced with a new short/long ram
induction system on the NA models. This was achieved using a plenum that
redirected air thru a shorter or longer passage- depending on throttle position
and vacuum. On the turbo models the manifold just went straight to the head.
This resulted in a much better throttle response, and with the added compression
gained both HP and torque. The 3rd generation revised the valve
adjustment set-up. The shim adjustment originally on top of the lifter, was
moved under the bucket- like the old 2TG/18RG set-up. This was to correct a
problem with shims falling out at very high RPM’s (on modified engines
specially with aftermarket sports cams). This was a modification introduced
earlier for higher lift and longer duration cams by sport tuners.</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>The 4th generation was upgraded to
incorporate variable timing and lift, similar to the later model 2JZ Supra /
Lexus engines. This engine finally found itself in RWD form in the Toyota
Altezza / Lexus IS200! Maybe Toyota is starting to listen. Finally the 3SG in
the important 2000cc class had power equivalent (or close enough) to other
offerings from other manufacturers.</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>In international competition the 3SG has powered
formula type cars that have been consistent international winners specially
under the TOM’S Racing Banner. The 3SGTE engines in WRC won for TTE (Toyota
Team Europe) several Championships for Toyota. It is also the engine used in the
WRC Champion Toyota Corolla, set up to a limited 300HP.</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>The engine is very similar to the JTCC / IMSA
Champion 503E engine- but none of the parts are interchangeable. In fact the
development of the 503 was the basis of the 3SG, in effect the 3SG was based on
a racing engine! A 503 was running even before the first 3SG.</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>This lightweight 2000cc block and 16 valve head
with Toyota lineage- is a must have for the old school Toyota camp, needing
(wanting?) a modern powerplant. We have available RWD conversion kits to
retrofit these engines for RWD!</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>With Toyota’s introduction of aluminum blocks,
this may be the last of the 4 cylinder iron blocks. This is important to note
because current new generations of aluminum blocks will need major preparation
to be able to reliably sustain HP outputs that this iron block will easily
survive. For ultimate Toyota power in the 2000cc class the 3SG is the final
answer.</b></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#0000FF"><b>MODIFYING THE 3SGE / 3SGTE</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Block: There are two different blocks-
turbo and non-turbo. The basic difference is that on the turbo block, the oil
passages for the turbo unit is pre-plumbed and piston oil coolers are present.
There is no strength difference. The later generation blocks have better
connecting rods (rods were similar on NA and Turbo of the same generation).
Early generation conrods are marginal if mega horsepower build up is
anticipated. As a minimum upgrade 1st generation rod bolts to ARP
units. Even in disassembly some rod bolts would snap! For any extended
performance upgrades go to Carillo Rods. (See other notes for RWD conversion).</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>These blocks are lightweight but structurally
stable. There is no perceived torsional weakness even under very high boost and
RPM levels. The crankshaft is also very robust. Chamfering the oil holes will
help reduce friction and guarantee good oil supply. Oil supply insufficiency has
killed more engines than boost! There are casting provisions for installing
piston oil coolers on the NA blocks. A competent machine shop should be able to
tap into the oil galleys with no problems. The oil feed bolt and squirter is now
available separately.</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>The latest generation blocks can be identified by
an aluminum block / oil pan extension. The oil filter is relocated low in the
front. The timing components are all different from the previous 2 generations.
We support parts for these engines.</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Stroking the engine to 5S specifications is a
possibility. Although the 3SG bore / stroke is already optimized for
performance, the additional 200cc of the 5S combined with a G head will provide
a noticeable increase in torque. This will however require new pistons. Ultimate
HP output will be limited by the weaker crank design. Definitely not for turbo
applications.</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Cylinder Head: Like all Toyota G type 16
valve heads, only minor porting is required. Except for early All Trac heads
(ST165), all heads can use the aftermarket cams. On the older ST165 All Tracs,
you will need to modify the lifter or valve because they will bottom up. Always
check the cam manufacturers suggestion specially if the lift is more than 7.5mm
and duration is over 288! Convert to- shim-under-the bucket, valve adjustment if
the car will see serious competition use. There is no advantage going bigger
valves, unless they have to be replaced anyway. If the heads need to be
resurfaced because of warpage- do not exceed 1mm cut. If it needs to be heated
to straighten out- replace the head. The head has to be surfaced to a mirror
finish if a metal head gasket is being used.</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>The 2nd generation (small port) head
is advisable on a ground-up engine preparation. This head will flow better than
the old TVIS type head- for turbo applications or individual throttle body
installations (and carbs too!). The 3rd generation head, when
available, is very hard to get and expensive, but still cheaper than buying the
shim adjustment conversion package. We have some available. The 4th
generation is almost impossible to set-up because all the electronic functions
are electrically related to the ECU- meaning drivetrain, suspension controls,
and steering inputs are first processed. Short of a stand-alone fuel injection,
it cannot be modified. If you have to ask how- please do not even begin.</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Rear Wheel Drive: The 2000cc 3SG is a good
choice for RWD conversion. We can supply the engine brackets, oil pick-up, oil
pan, flywheel, clutch set, and other related pieces to install in a RWD vehicle.
There is a choice of either T-type (Corolla) or W-type (Celica) transmissions.
Unless necessary, use the W type transmission. The T-type transmission is
marginal when engine output in excess of 180 hp is expected.</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>The non-turbo block has provisions for the L
& R engine brackets. The turbo block will need further modification to use
(there is no provision for the engine bracket on the turbo side). Whether the
planned application is turbo or non turbo- the NA block offers more flexibility
because of the present engine bracket bosses. Piston oil coolers can be
retrofitted on the block. Another advantage is that the oil cooler can be
relocated away from the area where the factory turbo normally hang. After-market
turbos cannot use the original factory turbo plumbing anyway.</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Depending on the install, the water pipe routing
will also need to be reconfigured (similar to the 4AG transverse going into a
RWD application). The distributor will also need to be configured, or the
firewall modified to clear it. A stand-alone Fuel injection set-up, with
ignition capability is the preferred way to go. This way the ignition timing can
be derived from a crank trigger, bypassing the distributor problem.</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>As mentioned earlier, oil delivery is crucial.
Although the original transverse oil pan can be used, the pick-up and baffling
is completely wrong. You have to get the correct RWD pan and oil pick-up, or
risk losing the engine due to oiling problems. The late model engines have a
higher output oil pump.</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Turbo Upgrade: The 3SGTE in both the All-Trac
(GT4, overseas) and MR2 have numerous after-market turbo upgrades available. The
factory turbo is able to run boosts up to 14 psi (1 bar). Trying to boost above
this is ill-advised. In order of importance- the exhaust, intercooler, boost
controller, ignition, fuel computer, turbo, vein pressure converter, injectors
are the steps in upgrading. For anything over 12 psi sustained, a new block with
forged pistons is necessary. Adjusting compression ratio for a non-turbo being
upgraded to turbo, by the head gasket is not recommended. The availability of
metal head gaskets in various thickness and composition is more to compensate
for the milling of the head and block, and slight adjustments in compression.</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>The most usable turbo upgrade is based on the
factory CT26 stock turbo. We were the first company to do this and maintain
proprietary specifications. Some companies also perform factory turbo based
upgrades, but ........... There are numerous other aftermarket single turbo
set-ups, but they are not as streetable, and for daily drivers become truly
intolerable.</b></font></p>
