The 1ZZFE and 2ZZGE are Toyota’s latest 4 cylinder engines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Both are all –aluminum 1800cc 16-valve engines with variable cam
timing, matching the current offerings of other manufacturers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This is Toyota’s first all aluminum 4 cylinder block.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The 1ZZFE introduced in 1988, without variable cam timing- was updated
with VVT, when the 2ZZFE debuted in 2000.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
2ZZGE- was further enhanced with a variable lift feature.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></b></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><b>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
The variable cam timing feature addresses the problem associated with the old FE
engines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(Please read the separate
notes in the TECH Section.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Without
VVT, the old engines seemed to run abruptly out of breathe- a function of their
smooth power delivery that promised “more”- but hit a performance wall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The VVT 1ZZFE and VVTi 2ZZGE- now have the performance surge to satisfy
the driver.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(Of course people will
still want more, which is why Toysport is in business.)<o:p>
</o:p>

<p><span lang="EN-US"><b>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
It is very interesting to note the difference between the two engines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The 1ZZFE and 2ZZGE are of the same displacement, but their bore and
stroke are different.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 1ZZFE
“izzy” with the FE head is the quick response, high torque model- has a
longer stroke ratio, to further improve the torque characteristic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The 2ZZGE “duzzy” with the sports type GE head is the high RPM,
higher HP unit- with a square bore / stroke ratio.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This allows it to rev and deliver power in the higher RPM range.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></b></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><b>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
The driving characteristic of both engines are dramatically evident.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the 2000 Celica, where both engines are offered- the GT with the 1ZZFE
is easier and smoother to drive- more responsive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The GTS with the 2ZZGE starts of lazier, and need lots of pedal- but
ultimately more HP.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Which is a good
contrast- drivers now know the trade-off between drivability and horsepower.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>A lot of people who tested the cars opted for the more
responsive GT model, although they were initially looking for power.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The power band characteristic of the two engines offer a good choice-
chooses which is more important.<o:p>

<font face="Arial" size="2">
A recurring question- why did the MRS end with the 1ZZFE?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Overall, the 1ZZFE was more compatible to the overall concept.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The 2ZZGE would need more attention driving (to extract the power)-
detracting from the fun aspect of cruising.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>For diehards- yes we can do the 2ZZGE conversion.<o:p>

From Toyota’s early pioneering Twin Cams, to the succeeding multi-valve DOHC
engines, to this new generation of variable cam timing and lift units…..Toyota
continues to be the world’s largest Twin Cam manufacturer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As a review: Toyota Twin Cams have seen it all- 2, 4, and 5 valves; four,
six, eight, twelve cylinders; normally aspirated, supercharged, turbo, and
twin-turbo; gas, propane, and diesel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>TVIS,
non-TVIS, and individual throttle bodies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Been
there, done that.<o:p>

BUILDING THE ZZ ENGINES<o:p>

<font face="Arial" size="2">
The aluminum block is hefty and casted really clean.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It will allow the engine to produce massive horsepower over stock.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Dimensionally they are bigger than the 4AGE, the engine family it is
superceding.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Block strengthening is
possible, by pinning the cylinders to stabilize the bores.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The crank is a lightweight design and so are the rods.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The crank and rods are casted really well, stress-relief and shot-peen-
will produce parts that look forged. <o:p>

<font face="Arial" size="2">
The 2ZZGE has problems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bent valves
from missed shifts have been common.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sticking
valve mechanism also cause unscheduled visits to the Toyota Dealers.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></b></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><b>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
Toyota is addressing these problems currently.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We have forged pistons in stock and .5mm os available with deeper valve
reliefs and a .5 higher compression.<o:p>
