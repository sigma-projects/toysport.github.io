FE Series Engines </font><o:p>

<p><b><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></span><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">The
various FE series engines (using the FE head design) are the most thoroughly
developed and purpose tuned Toyota power plants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the USA, 98% of current models Toyotas use this engine/head design.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The FE 4 valve per cylinder, narrow-angle Twin Cam heads (on the various
Toyota blocks) are the reason for the amazing response and smoothness of the
current generation Toyota motors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
high torque characteristic designed into these engines give the driver all the
advantages of the Twin Cam head design- plus low-end torque and fuel economy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Torque is the reason why these engines respond quickly and smoothly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The performance band has been engineered to provide power from low RPM to
the designated redline. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></b></p>
<p><b><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">There has been a lot of
requests for parts and modifications for these engines, but unfortunately trying
to raise the RPM band (or changing cams) will negate all the built-in attributes
of these engines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A camshaft change
to raise the power band higher, will result in the loss of low-end torque and
idling problems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Drivability will
suffer and the trade off will leave the customer with a compromised engine,
trying to work against the ECU program and engine design. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></b></p>
<p><b><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">By comparison, the
performance oriented GE versions of the same series engines, (if available on
the sporty models)- offer about a 20% horsepower advantage- but at a loss in low
RPM response and torque.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The GE
heads are more of the true Twin Cam design: wide-angle valves, long duration
cams- suited for high RPM and high output- but at the sacrifice of throttle
response in the lower RPM levels.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></b></p>
<p><b><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">There are improvements that
can be made to the FE engines- but the Toyota engineered power band should not
be altered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The ECU program and
Camshaft profiles, if changed will result in a loss of drivability and risk
internal damage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You cannot do a
better job than Toyota on coaxing power from these series engines, and needless
to say, stay street-legal.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></b></p>
<p><b><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">Upgrading these engines, is
of course still possible:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>intake
systems, exhaust components, ignition upgrades all help in fine-tuning these
engines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The rule to follow and
keep in mind is that all modifications are basically external in nature.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The only exception being pistons- to increase or decrease compression-
within the same RPM band.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turbocharging
and/or supercharging will help- but keep in mind that based on the design
parameters (again) these engines were designed for response- meaning lightweight
internals: con rods/crankshaft (as compared to the sportier GE series engines).<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></b></p>
<p><b><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">The short answer is- if you
are seeking a true high performance engine and high HP outputs- upgrade to the
GE version of your engine (if available).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
