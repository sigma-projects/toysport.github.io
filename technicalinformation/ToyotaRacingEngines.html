official Toyota Race Engines come from one source- TMC (Toyota Motor Corporation
Japan).<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><b>The
early beginning of Toyota motorsport involvement started with 4 engineers
working on production based engines.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Experimentation and experience led to the production of the
first<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Toyota Twin Cams- the 3M and
9R.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 3M powered the 2000GT and
the 9R powered the Corona 1600 GT.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
first race engines were prepared in-house by TMC’s Group 7 section
(manufacturing not racing!), starting in the late 60’s to early 70’s.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><b>In
1968 Toyota released it’s first race engine- a 3000cc V8, 2-vavle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The next year the engine became a 5000cc V8 4 valve.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>(A full 20 years before the Lexus LS 400 / Toyota Celsior!)<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>In another year the engine received Twin Turbos.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><b>The
early race engines were based on the K and T series Corolla / Celica street
engines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Group 7 engineers and
mechanics also developed the original racing twin cam models, 2TG (100E) and
18RG. These early Twin Cam engines were later issued with 16 valve heads with
highly modified stock blocks- 151E (2TG) and 152E (18RG), and a 16 valve Twin
Cam 3K too!– these were the first engines developed and assembled by TRD
(formerly known as TOSCO). <o:p>

supplied TTE (Toyota Team Europe) with base engines that TTE further developed
under Toyota Europe contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:

4TGTE, 3SGTE, and some 7MGTEs, but the basic production based blocks and heads
were from TMC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 1998 and 1999 Le
Mans engines were also produced by TMC and developed by TTE. During the last two
(and final) appearances of Toyota in Le Mans- these engines powered the fastest
cars in the event.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The new F1
project is a totally new project fully funded by TMC and jointly being developed
by TMG (Toyota Motorsport GmbH)- the new name for TTE.<o:p>

directly supplied some Japanese Toyota Race Teams with fully built engines
(TOM’s, TRUST, SARD, …… ) that these race teams further tuned externally.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Through the years, engines supplied included the original 2TG/18RG based
race units, the 16 valve 150 versions, the 4TGTEs, and the 503E engines.
Previously used in Le Mans, the 503Es are currently used in the Japan Touring
Series.<span style="mso-spacerun:

successful versions of the engine series (in Formula racing applications) are
not TMC issue.<o:p>
