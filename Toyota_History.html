Vehicles</span></h1>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-style: italic">We 
struggled through History 101, Economics 101, and most other subjects, but 
Toyota History and Vehicles, we know very well.&nbsp; Anyway here is Toysport’s take 
on Toyota from the beginning and into the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Today, Toyota is the world's 
third largest manufacturer of automobiles in unit sales and in net sales. It is 
by far the largest Japanese automotive manufacturer, producing more than 4.5 
million vehicles per year, equivalent to one every six seconds. In the time it 
has taken you to read this paragraph, at least another three or four TOYOTAs 
will have been produced! </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Tracing the roots of 
Toyota is best appreciated by observing the product line of the different stages 
in </span><span style="font-family: Arial">Toyota</span><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
history.&nbsp; There can be 5 distinct stages identified and also 5 main model lines 
that will define Toyota’s place in automobile history.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Arial">1<sup>st</sup> Stage&nbsp;
</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">When Toyota started 
producing motor vehicles, the major automobile manufacturers were already well 
established.&nbsp; The initial attempts were interrupted by WW II, which also leveled 
most European automobile plants.&nbsp; Borrowing heavily from British based cars and 
American trucks, the early Toyotas featured heavy European packaging influence 
and American engine design.&nbsp; The Toyopet Crowns, Tiaras, and early trucks that 
were produced were in fact just exercises in building the most basic 
transportation and automotive investigations in manufacturing techniques.&nbsp; As an 
emerging Japanese manufacturer, the evolution of Toyota products started slowly, 
with an eye for detail improvements.&nbsp; Gradually innovations were introduced, 
that soon was rapidly advanced when experience and know-how reached the level of 
other industry leaders.&nbsp; The Japanese industry was superior in taking an 
existing product not uniquely their own and revising and developing the product 
until their products became the world standard.&nbsp; A very ominous beginning, the 
automobile world was not prepared for.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Arial">2<sup>nd</sup> Stage&nbsp;
</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">With a growing 
manufacturing confidence, Toyota soon reached parity with European mass-market 
vehicles.&nbsp; In the early 60’s Toyotas compared well against European vehicles in 
the same class.&nbsp; By the mid 60’s all Toyota models easily matched the current 
European offerings in the mass-market models line-up.&nbsp; Established European 
technology was closely monitored and soon incorporated in the product line.&nbsp; 
Parallel development by the “other” Japanese auto manufacturer, led to a further 
acceleration of applied technologies that led to an explosion of Toyota and 
Japanese milestone models- from the sporty economy models to luxurious 
(European) full-size V8’s.&nbsp; The Japanese industry showed an obsession with 
matching specifications with the world’s best automobile manufacturers. Toyota’s 
encompassing commitment was shown in producing the Toyota 2000GT, a vehicle 
co-developed with Yamaha, from a design rejected by another Japanese 
manufacturer.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Arial">3<sup>rd</sup> Stage
</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;Corollas were introduced 
with DOHC engines (Alfa-Romeo and Fiat), Crowns came with SOHC sixes (Mercedes 
and BMW), and Crown V8’s/Centurys were equipped with the most extensive and 
lavish specifications (Rolls Royce). The Celica and Supra (Camaro/Mustang) was a 
new interpretation of sporty cars.&nbsp;&nbsp; And of course, the Land Cruiser (Land 
Rover) as the basic, dependable off-road icon.&nbsp; The focus was still solidly 
European inspired.&nbsp; On paper, Toyota models were soon matching specifications 
with the most established and advanced European models. On actual comparison, 
the European manufacturer still carried an edge in execution.&nbsp; Toyota, however, 
was under rapid technological advance.&nbsp; With manufacturing mastered, the focus 
soon turned to marketing.&nbsp; Marketing demanded innovation, and Toyota handily 
upped the ante for all manufacturers.&nbsp; Product specification and refinement gave 
Toyota a strong basis to start and become a major world player. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">The US auto market became 
the new field of expansion.&nbsp; Consumer input and market research became important 
product considerations.&nbsp; US and overseas manufacturing bases were strategically 
put in place. The Corolla (Volkswagen) became the world’s bestseller.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Arial">4<sup>th</sup> Stage</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Milestone models, Toyota’s 
interpretation of world-class cars, started appearing.&nbsp; Worldwide the Corolla 
was “the family sedan”. In the U.S,. the Camry became the family sedan standard, 
and a best seller.&nbsp; The MR2 was the new 2 seater sporty car.&nbsp; Toyota Pick-Ups, 
Trucks, and SUVs cover the entire market spectrum.&nbsp; Prius is the future hybrid 
available today.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Have you taken a look 
lately at the Global diversification of the new Toyota models?&nbsp; Different 
Corollas in different markets.&nbsp; In Japan all the new Models and Names are 
outright confusing.&nbsp; Toyota is bursting with all sorts of Niche type offerings.</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial">Lexus Division was the first authentic Japanese luxury 
brand launched on to the world market.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lexus has quickly established a 
reputation for the &quot;relentless pursuit of perfection&quot;. Introduced&nbsp; in 1990, 
Lexus model's exquisite quietness, smooth handling, and opulent luxury gained an 
immediate following in a market long dominated by European brands. With its 
advanced technology, supreme craftsmanship, and distinctive sense of style- the 
Lexus brand is leader and contender among the top luxury brands.&nbsp; What Lexus 
lacks in heritage it makes by its growing collection of international awards and 
titles. The rapid ascent to the pinnacle of automotive status is now automotive 
legend. </font> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><b>5<sup>th</sup> Stage</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial">The future Toyota models will continue to be 
evolutionary.&nbsp; Reliability, Quality, and Value will continue to rule.&nbsp; Hybrids 
and alternate fuel cars will power Toyota into the future. Toyota will continue 
to make a lot of cars and a lot of money.&nbsp; Like US manufacturers, on a good 
year.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial">The Lexus Division will remain focused on Prestige and 
Excellence.&nbsp; Rather than expanding volume or market share, Lexus will focus on 
Exclusivity and continue to pamper new and existing owners.&nbsp; Do not expect a 
true high performance model from Lexus. </font> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial">You would think Toyota got the market well covered.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 
There is this thing called Motorsports.&nbsp; Toyota has raced in all the major 
competitive events and……… you heard and read about it here first, OK?</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial">Start saving money.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial">The 3<sup>RD</sup> Toyota Division is on the way !&nbsp; A 
true high performance division will return to niche market the true performance 
models of Toyota.&nbsp; Models will range from entry level (pocket racers) to real 
high-end Gran Turismo.&nbsp; Remember in the mid 60’s-&nbsp; the Sports 800 and the 
2000GT?&nbsp; You get the picture…….</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial">Why do you think Toyota entered Formula 1?&nbsp;
</font> </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial">What will it be called?&nbsp; How much is the TOYSPORT 
name worth?</font></p>
