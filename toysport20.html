  The Thank You</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000FF">The Automobiles</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Our first customer car, a 1976 Toyota Celica Coupe 
  came all the way from Washington. Appropriately the license read- 1st TOY. This 
  was followed by countless other Celicas. At that time, the typical work order 
  was written up for carbs, cams, headers. Not too many people were aware of the 
  tuning potential of Toyotas. Second most popular request was for springs, shocks, 
  swaybars. After the engine mods, the car needed to be kept on the road!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Our first magazine car, a 1980 Toyota Celica GT-Rally 
  was a US model RA40, up-dated to full TRD Rally-Specification. It had a built 
  TRD 18RG 2.2 with all available TRD tuning parts- suspension (shocks, springs, 
  swaybars), close-ratio transmission, 4.8 LSD differentials, TRD seats, ….everything 
  in the catalog! Car was featured in Sports Car Graphic, the 1<sup>st</sup> Japanese 
  vehicle featured in that publication!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Our first show car, a 1982 Toyota Celica GTS came 
  from Toyota USA. This was when Kent Racing was handling the new IMSA program 
  for Toyota Motorsport. The car was prepared with the full IMSA body kit, 9X16 
  and 12X16 BBS 3 piece wheels, RECARO racing seats, and Suspension Technique 
  springs. We had a rally prepped- 152E engine for the car (that was never installed).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Our first pick-up, a 1980 Toyota 4X4. Basically 
  this became our rolling R&D project. On a continuing basis the truck would 
  come in for work, be used for a couple of months, come in for more power, be 
  used for a couple of months, come in for more power, ….and on and on. For 14 
  years. The power search ended with a Supra turbo engine- with all the HKS upgrades. 
  4 Wheeler Magazine said it was the fastest Toyota they ever tested.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Our first race car, a 1984 Toyota Celica GTS (from 
  Toyota) raced in the Macao Grand Prix, South East Asia’s most prestigious regional 
  race. This track is a Toyota favorite, where all top Japanese racing teams come, 
  to race against all the international competitors. This is the only documented 
  win by the Toyota 22R in international competition. It placed 3<sup>rd</sup>, 
  behind 2 six-cylinder factory prepared BMWs!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Our first race truck, a 1984 Toyota Class 7 Pick-Up 
  raced in the SCORE / HDRA series. This was campaigned for the 85 to 87 seasons. 
  All development work for our 22R Spec Desert engine was based on this unit that 
  won the Championship and received the biggest contingency money from Toyota. 
  Truly a grassroots program, 50% of logistics came from the winning pot, and 
  at least 25% from tire and parts sponsorship. The series had a huge following 
  and we supplied engines/parts to more than 6 Toyota private teams.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Our first rally car, a 1985 Corolla GTS (again 
  from Toyota) raced in the FIA sanctioned Olympus Rally in Washington State. 
  Our preparation, FIA Group N, earned us a spot in the same Toyota facility where 
  the headlined Group A Supras of Toyota Team Europe were also accommodated. This 
  was an international event, and our driver/navigator were FIA rated. The effort 
  finished 2<sup>nd</sup> in Class.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#0000FF"><b>The Clients</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">We have met and became friends with a lot of interesting 
  people. Somehow these personal relationships are more memorable and valuable 
  to Toysport than the vehicles they had brought us. For as varied the cars and 
  trucks we worked on, so are the personalities. Much as I am tempted, I cannot 
  name-drop.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">We have worked with lawyers, developers, doctors 
  (in all specialized fields), dentists, importers, exporters, racers, engineers, 
  stockbrokers, military people, entrepreneurs, computer talents, computer nerds, 
  advertising types, and (our favorite) restaurateurs. Even a Casino owner! We 
  have supplied race teams in the U.S., Japan, Europe, and the Caribbean Islands. 
  The customer who drove in the farthest for engine work on his car came from 
  Michigan. We have sent engines to all Asian capitals, the Middle East, Europe, 
  Caribbean islands. We have shipped to all the States of the Union, including 
  North Dakota and Puerto Rico.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">We have customers who won &quot;all the money back&quot; 
  in one weekend of racing. We have a customer in a Supra who terrorized the BMW 
  tuning shops in Northern California. We have a customer in a Corolla who worked 
  in a Honda Tuning shop. We have customers who challenged the canyons of Mulholland, 
  Black Mountain, and Azusa. We have Toyota employees from all departments come 
  in for &quot;aftermarket&quot; service. We have foreign students who attended 
  &quot;Toysport University&quot;- accessories before books; built-engines before 
  tuition; perfect attendance despite being non-compulsory. We have customers 
  who &quot;spent all the money&quot; here. We have had our share of obsessive-compulsive 
  types. Some unlicensed pharmaceutical distributors too!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">We have prepared cars for racers in SCCA, IMSA, 
  HDRA, SCORE, FIA, who have won national championships, regional events, and 
  other illegal night street races. Driver ability ranged from FIA rated to DMV 
  license impaired. This is why I cannot name names. Thank you, everyone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000FF"><b><font size="3">The Suppliers</font></b></font></p>

  Our first product line consisted of TRD (of course), Mikuni, Dough Thorley, 
  Centerforce, HKS, Recaro, Sway-Away, Jacobs, K&N. 20 years ago, Kaminari, 
  Suspension Techniques, MOMO, Centerforce, Tokico were also just starting up. 
  We directly helped launch Eibach, PIAA, Greddy, and others, who entered in the 
  late eighties and early nineties. As true partners we also helped out when others 
  were starting.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Thru numerous Japanese importers we introduced 
  Work wheels, Volk Racing, Hayashi, Autolook, Blitz before these companies opened 
  their U.S. trading companies. Toysport was a true pioneer in the import tuning 
  market and absolute leader for Toyota.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Nissan, Honda, Mazda, Maserati, Isuzu- Corporate 
  Offices have used our services for prototype work and promotion. Goodrich, Bridgestone, 
  General tires, Kenwood and JVC also directly worked with us. Thank you.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FF0000"><b><font size="3">TOYOTA</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">Yes, there are Toyotas made better. 
  Many divisions in Toyota have helped us out. From cars, to sponsorship, to technical 
  info, to rush orders, to race tickets, to technical info, and most important 
  for moral support. Toyota Motorsport, Toyota Product Planning, Toyota Public 
  Relations, Toyota Shows and Events, Toyota Emissions Lab, Toyota Technical Center, 
  Toyota Contingency Program, Toyota Accessory Development, Toyota Forklift, and 
  the Office of the President- Thank you all for your personal and corporate support.
