</font></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">The 4AG engines were
introduced in 1984 as the replacement to the 2TG.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Although a lot of knowledgeable Toyota enthusiasts welcomed
the 16 valve head, many kept back their excitement because the engine looked
fragile.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Internal pieces did not
follow the usual Toyota robust design.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
less time than the engines needed rebuilding, modified units were performing and
surviving in competition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Toyota
has rewarded it's Twin Cam diehards- with a new engine!<o:p>
</o:p>
&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">The secret in the 4AG's
compact and lightweight design was better metallurgy.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>This is how Toyota was able to guarantee 4AG durability equal
to its performance potential.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
iron block was preferred over all-aluminum units, with a minimal weight
disadvantage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 4AG can be
modified without the disastrous results of all-aluminum blocks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>For it's physical dimensions Toyota was wise to keep the iron block.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">As with any Toyota engine
design- the 4AG evolved.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The first
generation and second generation can be differentiated by their large or small
ports, and third generation with 5 valves!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The later versions had piston oil coolers, and higher compressions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The 4AG was very popular and during it's introduction and out ran any 4
cylinders 1600 with 16 valves.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Toyota Motorsports U.S.A.
initiated a development program for these engines, and have been rewarded with a
successful Formula Atlantic series.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These
heavily modified engines maintained all the 4AG dimensions, with modifications
to the original block and cylinder heads.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As
a full racing engine the 4AG has proven itself.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">The 4AG originally powered
3 distinct drive arrangements- RWD (Corolla GTS), Mid-Ship (MR2), and FWD
(FX16).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There is 2 possible 4WD
conversion available, but must only be used with stock HP output.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The later model Toyotas all went FWD, by which time the 4AG was in its 2<sup>nd</sup>
generation (1990).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 4AG
disappeared from the U.S. market by mid-91.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>By the 3<sup>rd</sup> generation, in Japan, the GTS 4A-GE and GTZ 4A-GZE
Supercharged engines were replaced by the 4AG 5 valve (1992).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The 5-valve has also a 2<sup>nd</sup> generation (1996).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The 4AG series evolved from 115HP to 170HP.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">The 4AG, because of its
lightweight and compact design, is a very popular choice for diverse
applications.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Desert racing buggies
(qualifying for the Toyota Contingency program), Lotus 7 replicas, and the older
Toyota Corollas and Starlet all support the &quot;modern&quot; 4AG engines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Engine conversion kits are available.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>There is tremendous respect for these power units, specially for RWD
applications.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">In Japan there is resurgent
interest based on a comic hero, whose 4AG Corolla has taken and beaten all
comers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This fantasy based on
reality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Japanese performance parts
manufacturers, after discontinuing sports part production, have again scheduled
4AG parts for production.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Just like
the engine it replaced, the 2TG, the 4AG is the Toyota engine for a whole new
generation.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">The U.S. 4AG-ZE in the MR2
developed 140HP with the supercharger and with strictly bolt-on modifications
produced 188HP.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There was available
a Twin Charger kit from HKS that developed 210HP and after further modifications
produced in excess of 350HP!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Also
available was the HKS 5AG kit (not a Toyota designation), which included a
stroked crank and over-size pistons for 1720cc.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">We have rallied the 4AG
Corolla AE86 in many international FIA events.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The cars are very competitive in Group N. One of the first Corollas we
prepared was for SCCA GT 2, which ended up in South America.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We have exported prepared 4AG engines to 5 countries!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>MR2s in SCCA IT (Improved Touring) are disadvantaged in the class, but
with a little tuning (late model blocks) become really competitive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We have set-up both cars for SCCA Solo ! and II.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">The fastest set-up is the
Twin Charged MR2, and is completely streetable.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately the kit is no longer available. Turbo engines
can be set-up for ultimately more HP, but ac lot less tractable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The turbo engines, with forged or supercharger pistons, easily outrun the
4AGZ, with the same psi output. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The
4AGZE engined MR2 and RWD/FWD Corolla conversions with the HKS (10 psi) big
pulley puts out at least 175 to 200.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There
are bigger pulley kits, example:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Cusco
(14 psi), that will definitely need additional EFI programming.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Mild cams and injectors can be combined for phenomenal cc. to HP output
ratios.<o:p>

</span>The 4AG block is a free revving and strong bottom end.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>A stock block will survive in excess of 350 HP if air-charged in the 8000
RPM range, or 250 HP in the 10000RPM range.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The 2<sup>nd</sup> generation blocks with oil squirters
should be the minimum considered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
connecting rods are also beefier, similar to the 4AGZ. The 1<sup>st</sup>
generation block had smaller wrist pins and rod journals, which should be fine
for milder tunes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For serious
competition the rods should be replaced.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Stroking the crankshaft to
a maximum 81mm will keep the RPM capability intact.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Bores can be brought out to 83mm, but try to keep it under
82.5mm. There is no need for the Formula Atlantic crankshaft.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Reject blocks that will need 83mm to clean up, for sure there is head
damage also.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Stay away from the 7AF to
7AG conversion since the crank is not forged and the flywheel bolts are too
small, with no provision available to upgrade.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The rods are potential failures also when subjected to real 4AG RPM
operation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is an exercise in
creativity but a total sidestep for any real performance-oriented application.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>If you like the torque of the 7AF, use the complete engine.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial">Cylinder Head:</span></b><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>There are some issues about the Formula Atlantic head.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Formula Atlantic head is a modified 4AG head- port and polished with
the valve adjusters changed to the under-the-bucket shim arrangement (similar to
the 2TG and 18RG).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The valves and
springs are different too. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>This
modification is required when running camshafts with high lift and/or long
duration (above 300).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For street
purposes there is no advantage converting to this adjustment method or preparing
the head to Atlantic specifications.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
port and chamber modifications will decrease performance- short of preparing the
complete engine to Formula Atlantic specifications, which will render the
package totally unstreetable.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">There is very minimal head
preparation needed, aside from match porting and polishing the runners.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Porting the heads on this 16 valve Twin Cam more often decreases the air
velocity- resulting in poorer throttle response.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Despite others claim of a 20HP or more increase- on modified heads alone,
this is simply impossible without camshaft or pistons changed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Toyota has casted and machined all their 4 valve heads to very close and
accurate tolerances for street (and rally) use.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Camshaft choices for stock
EFI systems and pistons should be limited to less than 265 duration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Upgraded blocks with pistons of at least 10.5:1 compression may use up to
288.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is recommended to convert
to under-the-bucket shims for durations over 300 (with corresponding higher
compression pistons).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Installing
high duration cams on the stock set-up will cause the shims to fall-off and
instant result in instant engine seizure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As
always stay away from reground cams with non-factory lobe centers, you will have
problems getting the correct adjustment shims.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">On the 4AGZ intake
manifold- the #1 runner, which is dog-legged, must be filled and recontoured.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This is a simple procedure that must be done.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Be sure to frequently check the supercharger oil also.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Many units have died because of oil starvation.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">The 5 valve head is
Toyota's bonus to the 4AG after the 4AGZE went away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>With the additional valve and independent throttle bodies- the 4AG 20
valve is a unique head design.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
head unfortunately has many proprietary pieces and the only way to do a
conversion to a 5 valve is only with a complete engine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The distributor position may be a problem in RWD installations. (Note:
There are 2 versions of the 5-valve engine, see related information under
Japanese engines).<o:p>

Upgrade-<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></b><span style="font-family:Arial">The
preparation for the turbo set-up is to lower the compression.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The 4AG / 4AGZ that will see boosts in excess of 10 psi should be set-up
with forged pistons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Blocks with
the oil squirters must be used as these come with the better rods.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>For boosts higher than 18 psi, the rods have to be replaced.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Oil cooler is mandatory, and for all applications a bigger radiator is a
good investment.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Use the 4AGZ injectors and fuel pressure regulator for turbo
conversions of the normally aspirated 4AG.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>550cc injectors are available for serious boost / engine outputs. The
fuel pump can be replaced with the Supra Turbo pump, a direct bolt-in.<b><o:p>

the dual side-draft carbs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The cost
for the carbs / manifold plus ignition conversion will come close to a new fuel
injection system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The EFI system
will be adequate for minor tuning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>4AG/Z
EFI systems use either an AFM (air flow meter) or MAP (manifold air pressure).<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The AFM model is actually preferred since it will allow the
user some adjustability for modified cams; there is no compensation available
with MAP sensors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no
advantage to converting to a MAP sensor, the idea of loss HP due to the AFM
restriction is not true. <o:p>

pressure tuning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Forged high
compression pistons are reasonably priced and are a good upgrade.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
