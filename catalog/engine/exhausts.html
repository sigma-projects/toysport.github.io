The SP Exhaust Systems are designed to provide maximum power increase by coupling the optimum size of mandrelbent tubing to straight through silencers which offer the maximum amount of flow possible.  Turbocharged engines will benefit from near linear boost build-up, while normally-aspirated engines will produce a clear, sporty sound.  Available in either Stainless Steel or Aluminized material.
