The origin of Mikuni PHH carburetor dates back to the operation of the Solex carburetor approximately 35 years ago.  Mikuni PHH carburetors have been used in Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Mitsubishi and Isuzu in their race vehicles and high performance production vehicles.

<dd>One might ask what is the difference between Mikuni carburetors to other brands of carburetors?  First, it has a <em>light weight float</em>.  Even under intense vibrations of racing conditions, the extra light float, made of the most modern materials, resists the effects of harmful vibrations.  Even under the most severe racing conditions the float will maintain the proper fuel level and provide a fuel mixture that is neither too rich or too lean.  Next is the <em>float chamber design</em>, which will maintain the proper volume under any vibration condition and from any angle.  The result is a hesitant-free carburetor regardless of motion under any racing condition.  The <em>accelerator pump</em> features diaphragm-type construction which avoids the performance dropouts often associated with the piston type pumps.  The <em>throttle bore tolerance</em> is controlled to within the maximum of 0.0002 inches through the careful use of a precise diamond cutter.  Each throttle bore receives a selected high-tolerance throttle valve.  The 44PHH comes equipped with a <em>cooling body</em> to prevent perfolation of fuel.  The addition of a return fuel pipe to the standard cooling body is Mikuni-engineered solution to the percolation problem.  The <em>needle valve</em> of the PHH carburetors provide <em>excellent engine starting</em> characteristics.  A choking system is <em>not</em> required as the accelerator pump can be used as a primer.  <em>Fuel level adjustments</em> for the PHH carburetors are extremely stable over long periods of time.  Special alloy construction adds to the durability.  Both inner and outer venturies are double locked into position by a screw and nut.  They should never loosen thus eliminating fuel leakage problems.
<p>
<dd>This fact is no coincidence!  Mikuni PHH carburetors can be seen in the winners circle of prestigious racing events all over the world such as Baja 1000, Road Atlanta, and Australia's Southern Cross.  Mikuni's involvement in racing has helped us to create a carburetor that outperforms any other carburetor in the high performance off-road situations.
