Isky cams uses today's most advanced computer-generated designs.  Features Isky's exclusive SLC (Strategic Lift Command) formula, a cam design program which for the first time made it possible through careful scrutiny of the profile dynamics to achieve a near "Zero Jerk" Acceleration Curve.  The result is the valve control over a wider RPM range while capturing greater area under the lift curve than ever before.  This design is so smooth, higher revving and easier on critical valve train components.  Some of the most exacting equipment in the industry is employed at Isky Racing Cams to insure you the highest quality control and most accurate cams in the world.
