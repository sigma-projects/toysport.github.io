<strong>VEIN PRESSURE CONVERTER</strong>
<br>
The HKS VPC is designed to physically and electronically replace OE air metering devices which present a significant restriction to the intake system and offer no adjustment or reprogramming options to take advantage of dramatically higher air flow or larger fuel injectors.  The VPC converts both air flow meter and air mass sensor systems to what is called a speed density system by utilizing a 16 bit central processing unit reading its own intake air temperature sensor and absolute pressure transducer signals.  Another benefit of the VPC is the ability to create programs to take advantage of larger fuel injectors and new air flow characteristics.  To take full advantage of the VPC, HKS VPC Power Flow adaptors together with the Super Power Flow Air Filter should be used.

<strong>PFC F-CON PROGRAMMED FUEL COMPUTER</strong>
<br>
The PFC F-CON is a plug-in fuel computer designed to supplement and refine the OE specified fuel curve for many popular Japanese vehicles.  F-CONs are available for most factory turbocharged Japanese vehicles, HKS turbo kits and potentially some normally aspirated applications.  F-CON and the resulting signal can allow for a longer pulse width for factory injectors or take advantage of larger injectors to ensure a proper air/fuel ratio during high air flow conditions.

<strong>SUPER POWER FLOW</strong>
<br>
Super Power Flow systems have been engineered to dramatically reduce inlet restrictions posed by today's sealed factory boxes.  Super Power Flow represents the ultimate in filtered air flow.  It consists of a filter element that is a wet type polyurethane filter which incorporates a special sticky fluid chemical process.  A process is used to ensure that this chemical bonds to the polyurethane filter element which helps the filter achieve its maxium filtering capability.  HKS has also developed a lip shaped funnel which creates a vacuum behind the lip.  As a result, air is drawn in from the outer edges of the filter which can achieve maximum air intake efficiency.  The end result is a smooth and even air flow with increased engine response, horsepower and fuel mileage.

<strong>ELECTRONIC VALVE CONTROLLER (EVC)</strong>
<br>
The HKS Electronic Valve Controller continues to represent the state-of-the-art in electronic boost control, with the most sophisticated microprocessor and adjustment valve available.  The EVC was designed to allow adjustment of boost pressure from the cockpit of vehicles equipped with turbochargers.  Since all turbos do not share the same characteristics, the EVC's central processing unit actually learns, then maximizes, the boost curvers.  The new EVC comes with some new featuers as compared to the old EVC, it is capable of high boost up to 30 psi, a digital boost meter, direct boost input, three mode adjustments, scramble boost, selected boost memory, warning feature, wastegate slection and fuzzy logic programming.
<p>
<strong>TURBO TIMER</strong>
<br>
The HKS Turbo Timer is designed to extend the life of the turbocharger by allowing the engine to idle for a pre-set time after the ignition key has been turned off and removed from the key cylinder.  This permits the engine oil to circulate through the turbocharger bearing housing which draws heat out of the bearing and impeller shaft to bring temperature down to a safe level before the engine is shut down.  Other features include a timer mode, audible alarm, and add mode.  HKS offers a quick plug-in installation harness for most vehicles.
