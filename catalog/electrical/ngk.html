<strong>NGK Spark Plug Resistor Wire</strong>
<br>
The fiberglass core is covered by a layer of ferrite magnetic material wrapped with variably-pitched metal wire.  This produces the impedance necessary to suppress radio frequency interference throughout the entire frequency spectrum thus supressing ignition noise on radios.  The outer jacket insulation features either NGK's more highly heat resistant EPDM new rubber compount, "see-thru" polyvinyl chloride, or NGK's new silicone insulation, dependent on which is the best for each individual application.

<strong>NGK V-Spark Plug</strong>
<br>
A special thin center electrode tip require less juice to make the spark and ignite the mixture.  That means fast, sure starts, less misfiring, even in the coldest climate.  Made of precious metal, the electrode resists corrosion and oxidation.  NGK V-Plugs have heat dissipating copper core, long anti-fouling nose.  Their wide heat range is within the exact thermal limits for best performance.
