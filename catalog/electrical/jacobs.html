<strong>Ultra Team</strong> is a complete factory-coordinated ignition system, made up of the Engergy Pak computer, Ultra Coil, Energy Core spark plug wires, and Wire Markers and Separators.  This high-powered system is guaranteed to produce an immediate increase in performance, horsepower, low end torque, mileage and engine life for virtually all vehicles.
<p>
<strong>Energy Pak</strong>, the "brain" of the system, adjusts spark output, cylinder-to-cylinder, according to engine need, producing smooth running at low or high rpm, at higher altitude, in cold weather or under weak spark plug conditions.  Available in 4 different models; Perform Master, Pro-Street, Pro 10 and Marine Master.
<p>
<strong>Omni-Pak</strong> is a complete high-energy computer controlled ignition and Jacobs variable magnetic ignition coil.  Fully waterproof and shockproof.  By optimizing the compatibility of the coil's characteristics to that of the electronic ignition effectiveness, hence a significant boost in mileage, power, and performance is attained.
<p>
<strong>Ultra Coil</strong> has all the benefits of the Energy Coil, but more so.  It is the most rugged coil available with lowest primary resistance of any street-driven coil (only 0.45 ohms).  Ultra Coil is a real must for the racer a performance enthusiast, anyone with a modified engine.
