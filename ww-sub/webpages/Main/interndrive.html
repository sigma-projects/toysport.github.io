</span><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red">SUMMER EDITION </span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:Arial">We are web-impaired.</span></b><span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp; 
With that out of the way- here is our best shot. We have been totally 
overwhelmed with the continuing and increasing popularity of this INTERNET 
DRIVE.&nbsp; The volume of visitor “hits” has been constantly increasing- moving our 
bandwith usage higher and higher- despite remaining stagnant for almost a year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">While you are exploring the many new updates, 
please take notes, check accuracy, and help point out missing or wrong links and 
other errors. Your input is important to help make cruising this site trouble 
free.&nbsp; Some pages are still under preparation, so please check back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">There are over 60 new articles, 200+ 
pictures, 12 new product lines, and 70 updated catalog listings- by the time all 
updates are done for this Summer Edition. The whole month of July will see 
almost daily updates.&nbsp; This is the only way we can do this instead of waiting 
for everything to be brand new in one launch.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">The biggest challenge remains- the continuous 
updates and maintenance of this website- before winter.&nbsp;&nbsp; We are now doing the 
website in-house.&nbsp; So updates will be more frequent and regular.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">It is our goal to keep this Toysport Internet 
Drive more current and up-to-date.&nbsp; A shopping cart feature will be up too, by 
August.&nbsp; All your comments and suggestions are solicited ….. a good word will be 
appreciated too…..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Thank you</span></font><br>
