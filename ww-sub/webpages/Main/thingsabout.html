        <p><strong><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Some Things About 
        Toysport</span></strong><b><br>
        </b><br>
        <span style="font-family:Arial">In 1980 Toysport was established to 
        distribute Toyota Racing Development (TRD) sport parts. Working as 
        in-house consultant for TRD USA, Toysport initiated the &quot;grass-root&quot; 
        support program for Toyota racers. The program evolved into Toyota's 
        Contingency Program, when Toyota USA formed Toyota Motorsport in 1981. 
        Ever since the beginning Toysport has actively supported Toyota USA's 
        corporate goals and the Toyota enthusiasts’ needs.<br>
        <br>
        Team Toysport America Limited was incorporated in 1982. Toysport 
        continues to supplement and complement the activities of Toyota 
        Motorsport and TRD USA. Toysport handled vehicle preparation for Toyota 
        shows and events. Toysport also prepared all magazine cars for TRD USA 
        and Toyota Public Relations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Overseas, the principals of Toysport have 
worked with TOYOTA (Japan) since 1965, and TOSCO (the original corporate name of 
TRD (Japan) since 1972. The relationship continues into the next millennium.<br>
<br>
The initial thrust of Toysport was engine development and accessory 
distribution. Working with &quot;grassroots&quot; Toyota racing teams and U.S. aftermarket 
parts manufacturers allowed Toysport to be in the center of parts development 
and competition preparation. Toysport's commitment to Toyota racers and 
enthusiasts was total and encompassing. This commitment earned us the continued 
cooperation of TOYOTA, TRD (Technocraft), TRD USA, the aftermarket manufacturers 
and importers. Toysport has worked continually in expanding and developing our 
product lines. Affiliated businesses have also responded to our needs by adding 
and supplementing our product lines on a continuing basis. This evolved into 
Toysport becoming the leading Toyota Tuning Specialist and Warehouse Distributor 
for Toyota sports parts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">In1985 Toysport had achieved the highest 
level of product and technical support for Toyota enthusiasts. From the leading 
winners in Toyota's contingency program to the top Toyota Racing Teams worldwide 
(TOM's Racing and TRUST of Japan), Toysport was actively involved in Motorsport 
activities. Our customers were entered in various SCCA, IMSA, SCORE and HDRA 
events. Our customers have won National championships for Toyota. Toysport 
entered international FIA sanctioned events and always placed in the top two 
positions in their classes, a perfect record. Multiple race track records were 
also set in the U.S.<br>
<br>
Attention away from Motorsport activities was a result of the tremendous 
business in the Toyota aftermarket. 1985 and 1986 model years saw the strongest 
Toyota sports model line-up in U.S. Toyota history. This started in 1972 with 
the Celica and SR5 Corollas, both milestone cars. The Toyota 4X4 Truck business 
started in 1979 added to the frenzy. The introduction of the 3rd generation 
Celica GTS and Supra in 1982 greatly expanded the business. The arrival of the 
Twin Cam Corollas and MR2 in 1985 was followed by Turbo models- Toyota 
enthusiasts were abundant, and Toysport was THE SOURCE.<br>
<br>
By 1988 with the continued infusion of sporty Toyota
<a href="../../../webpages/Techinfo/References/toyota_twin_cam_article.html" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
TwinCam</a> models in the </span><span style="font-family:
  Arial">U.S.</span><span style="font-family:
Arial"> market, Toysport was busy attending consumer and trade shows and 
preparing magazine vehicles. The influx of more Japanese parts alleviated the 
need to develop parts locally. At this time more than 60% of our inventory were 
locally sourced, 30% were still imported, and the remaining parts were Toysport 
proprietary products.<br>
<br>
In 1990 we purchased our present building. Just like the cars we worked on, we 
have continually upgraded the facility. Our showroom, which is in continuous 
changing flux, has the most comprehensive display of sports parts; our service 
facility prepares engines and prototype work non-stop; our engine and chassis 
dyno allow continuous engine tuning and development. Expanded foreign sales keep 
us busy identifying correct applications for foreign </span>
<span style="font-family:Arial">Toyota market models. We were exporting sports 
parts and accessories to Toyota enthusiasts and racers all over the world. Our 
expanded parts support for Old School and Milestone Toyota models has proven 
very successful and rewarding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">We have aggressively imported more varieties 
of Toyota engines than Toyota dared to bring in. Two, Four, Five valve TwinCam 
engines. Turbo, Super-charged, and Twin-charged. Single plug and Twin plug. 
Street, Prototype, Rally, and Racing. Been there, done that. Toyota Technicians 
from the different Toyota Regional centers (in town for official Toyota 
corporate business) regularly visit to see engines and cars that they only read 
about and see in pictures. Toyota dealers call us for their customers’ special 
needs. Every year we tease Toyota employees with Toysport prepared vehicles in 
the Toyota Oktoberfest car show at Toyota headquarters.<br>
<br>
The performance aftermarket changed in the 90's, affecting Toyota's sports image 
seriously (and our business as a result). The sporty new models from Toyota 
stopped coming, current models disappeared, and Toyota lost it's following for 
new entry-level sports car buyers. Ironically, the sports aftermarket was 
expanding with all the other sporty and exotic offerings from other 
manufacturers. We participated in that boom. We tuned and modified a lot of 
Nissans, Mazdas, and Hondas- but we proudly kept our Toyota hat on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">By 1995 it was clear that the strong 
popularity of sporty Toyotas to the consumers was gone. The Toyota diehards 
insisted in RWD and kept all the older RWD models rolling. The Toyota Turbo 
models trickled in but the widely based Corolla and Celica market was passed 
over by the sports minded consumers. Fortunately, we have managed to capture 
more of the Toyota specialty market. The different Toyota clubs send us 
membership business. Our resources for Toyota parts remain phenomenal and 
unbeatable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Toyotas never die; they just get modified and 
restored. The Starlets, Corollas, Celicas, Supras, and MR2s continue to come for 
fresh power, suspension upgrades, or total restoration. Yes, the exotic 2000Gts, 
Sport 850s, Century, Crowns, and Soarers still come or call. Tercels, Camrys, 
and RAV4s are regulars. The pick-up truck and Land Cruiser market has never been 
our focus, but we have prepared the best ones for the magazines and won National 
Championships!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Our expertise in Toyota tuning has opened 
other major venues. Our reputation led to some unsolicited factory contracts. We 
worked with Nissan Competition on some prototype turbo vehicles and raced 
Showroom Stock 300ZXs. We worked with Mazda in the introduction of the 2nd 
generation RX7 Turbo. We worked with Honda Research and Mugen on Honda turbos 
(when they were in their old Gardena location). Naturally no important 
information was shared. It was exciting times and a continuing learning process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">We continued working with Toyotas and have 
turbocharged and modified more Toyota models, than any other company. We are 
honored to be &quot;a pioneer of the import high performance industry&quot;, for &quot;being 
around forever&quot;, as the &quot;premier Toyota aftermarket specialist&quot; and being &quot;the 
ultimate skunkworks for modified Toyotas&quot;. Yes, we have had to defend Toyota and 
Toyota products to non-<i>Toyotaphiles</i> (and unhappy Toyota owners). We are 
proud that our organization has maintained the longest continuous management 
effort of any Toyota tuning and sports parts related business. Magazines 
continue to give us editorial space despite remaining basically non-advertisers.<br>
<br>
Our business ties to past and current suppliers is one of mutual support and 
technical exchange. We have been the first distributor for TRD and HKS. Kaminari, 
PIAA, Tokico, Centerforce, Sway-Away, Momo, Suspension Techniques, Eibach- all 
used Toysport to help fit, test, and launch their products. We were early 
distributors for Greddy, K&N, Cibie, Mikuni, Recaro, Dough Thorley, and others</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Our friends, customers, and dealers in North 
and South America, the islands in the West Indies, the European Economic 
Community, and the deserts and oasis of the Middle East, the African continent, 
Australia, and all the nations in SE Asia- has given Toysport an international 
presence. We have associates in the Toyota Network- in the US, Japan, and the 
different foreign markets were Toyotas roam and race. Friends and former 
employees work in the different Toyota Race Teams, Corporate office, in the US 
and Worldwide.<br>
<br>
The Internet allows us to reach and service more Toyota customers. Our website 
is a frequent stop for Toyota enthusiasts. We are challenged to keep up with 
E-mail inquiries and requests. It has saved a lot on postage and long distance 
phone bills, more important it allowed a much faster and accurate order 
turnaround and better customer service. With our new distribution center in the 
Philippines, we will be able to serve all our international markets better, with 
additional product lines and expanded inventory levels.<br>
<br>
In 2000, Toysport celebrated 20 years of service to the Toyota enthusiasts in 
the U.S. The first 20 years have proven challenging but very rewarding. Our 
clientele base, which has changed demographically and geographically- has 
continued to grow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">In 2003, Toysport concentration will be in 
parts distribution.&nbsp; We have accumulated and built the largest inventory of 
Toyota parts and accessories- stored in 3 different locations.&nbsp; We are still in 
the market for a bigger facility, but operations continue at full scale in our 
current location.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">We have met so many enthusiasts, made so many 
friends, and faced so many different characters that a book can easily be filled 
with amusing and amazing stories. We thank all our past and current customers 
for making all this activities possible. We look forward to servicing new 
customers, making new friends, and helping everyone get the most out of their 
Toyotas. We welcome you to come join us.</span></p>
