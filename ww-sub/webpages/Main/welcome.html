</b><font face="Arial"> 
<p><font size="3">For many of our customers, a visit to Toysport is a surprise 
  part of a vacation. Families from around the world come to visit the many sites 
  of Southern California, and frequently the Toyota diehard in the family- manages 
  to squeeze in time to visit our showroom and facility (the whole family in tow). 
  Business people too, often schedule meetings with enough free time to drop by. 
  Even Toyota personnel from the different Regional offices, in town for official 
  (Toyota) national headquarters business, regularly visit to see what’s new. 
  On long weekends, visitors drive-in from out-of-town. Race weekends bring car 
  clubs and motorsports enthusiasts to continue bench-racing while visiting and 
  checking out the cars and parts.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">We have not disappointed our visitors- judging by their excited 
  reaction when they see the most comprehensive display of Toyota sports parts. 
  Some Toyota items that only we have, make the visit totally worthwhile. Often, 
  new inquiries and old questions are answered by a simple visit. Just like a 
  tour destination (&quot;tourist trap&quot;)- Toyota curios, gadgets, engines, 
  accessories, and hardware are here to view, hold, examine, compare, and (hopefully!) 
  purchase. Often, Toysport is the first and last stop of the LA visit- first 
  to order parts and then to pick-up on the way home. Often too, the visit is 
  to meet the face of the voice on the phone or behind the e-mail address.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">There is nothing like Toysport, if you are a Toyota enthusiast. 
  We are true Toyotaphiles. We enjoy and pamper our Toyotas. We are dedicated 
  to making your Toyota, into the best Toyota. Like you, we are Toyota obsessed.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">There is nothing that will replace a &quot;brick and mortar&quot; 
  business. In this age of e-commerce, did you ever wonder how many businesses 
  actually stock and know the products? You can never develop know-how and experience 
  without actually installing, using, testing, and evaluating the products. Talk 
  is cheap and easy. Naturally, some information we have will to remain proprietary. 
  Some sites in &quot;cyberspace&quot;, claim a lot of experience. Some sites 
  have a lot of information and misinformation. In Toysport, it is accurate and 
  real.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Most of the articles on this website are presented in a conversational 
  tone. We tried to keep it brief and interesting. The aim is to inform and is 
  not meant to be instructional. We try to recreate an actual visit.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Before you proceed please take a minute to read our ONLINE WEBSITE 
  POLICY and other LEGAL NOTICES.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">And so, here we proudly present the next best thing, enjoy your 
  Internet visit……….come back often……….but see you soon anyway!</font></p>
