this will come as a front cut (or rear cut for MR2). The engine and all 
components are still in the original engine compartment (chassis) what you get 
are all the mechanical parts to do the conversion: engine with all engine 
accessories; all engine related harness, ecu, relays, and sensors; 
transmission.&nbsp; Sometimes axles and struts, radiators and condensers are 
included, depending on the parts we receive.&nbsp; Prices are quoted depending on 
what is included.&nbsp; Sheetmetal is never included, but sometime are left on the 
clip.&nbsp; example: NA MR2 to turbo or supercharged</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><b><span style="color: blue">TRANSPLANT PACKAGE</span></b><span style="color: blue">-
</span>&nbsp;this will come as a (1) complete engine without the accessories 
(alternator, power-steering pump, AC compressor; (2) un-cut harness to the ECU, 
and (3) ECU.&nbsp; You will need sensors and relays- on some cars the original pieces 
may work.&nbsp; If the transplant engine is a close generation to your car, some 
engine accessories may work. example:&nbsp; 4AGE to 4AGZE</font></p>
<h1><font face="Arial"><span style="color: blue"><font size="3">ENGINE UPGRADE/REPLACEMENT PACKAGE</font></span><font size="3"><span style="color: blue; font-weight: normal">-</span>
</font><span style="font-weight: normal"><font size="3">this will come as a 
complete engine with manifolds; the engines come without the accessories 
(alternator, power-steering pump, AC compressor; normally this is ordered to 
replace the same or similar engine.&nbsp; Some electrical parts (distributor, coil 
packs, sensors) are usually left with the engine, but are not part of what you 
paid for.&nbsp; example:&nbsp; 5MG to 6MG upgrades</font></span></font></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><b><span style="color: blue">LONG BLOCK ENGINE</span></b><span style="color: blue">-</span>&nbsp; 
this will be the cylinder head and block- valve cover to oil pan.&nbsp; No 
manifolds.&nbsp; all internal parts are as installed on the head and block.&nbsp; your 
original manifolds may work with slight modification.&nbsp; example:&nbsp; 3SGTE 
blue-printed and built engines</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><b><span style="color: blue">SHORT BLOCK</span></b><span style="color: blue">-</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
this will be the engine block only, with crankshaft and pistons;&nbsp; Japanese 
blocks will interchange with U.S. blocks with no problem;&nbsp; if you intend to use 
as a street engine use this with your original U.S. head and emission controls; 
these blocks are usually updated versions.&nbsp; example: hi-compression 4AGE to U.S 
4AGE</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><b>NOTE:</b>&nbsp; These engines are all Japanese specification 
and do not have EGR provisions, some can be retrofitted, some cannot; and some 
where never imported into the U.S.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although most engines will pass a tailpipe 
test, they are not legal for U.S. certification without an EGR retrofit.&nbsp; <b>
Toysport imports and sells Japanese specification engines for competition use 
only.</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Expect to change all tune-up related parts- sparkplugs, 
distributor wire/cap/rotor; thermostat; timing/fan belts.&nbsp;&nbsp; For high performance 
engines changing rings and head-gasket is recommended, but most engines sold are 
used by our customers as received.&nbsp; On older model engines, reconditioning is 
highly recommended.&nbsp; <b>There is no warranty on high performance engines.</b></font><o:p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-size: 16.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
