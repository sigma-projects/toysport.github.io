Used Japanese Engines</font></b><br>
<br>
Car maintenance in Japan is different from the U.S. and most of the world. 
Without a license to work on vehicles, purchasing parts and even manuals is 
restricted. Safety related maintenance items like brakes are specially 
regulated. There are very few Do-It Yourselfers, considering that most cars are 
recycled in 5 years, there is almost no need to fix things.<br>
<br>
The availability of good low mileage used engine and drive train components from 
Japan is a result of all the factory-serviced vehicles and early recycling. Note 
too that since Japanese vehicles are hardly used for long trips- light brown 
deposits visible thru the filler cap do not translate to high mileage. Even dark 
tar-like deposits are sometimes only accumulated on the cylinder head.<br>
<br>
As all facets of car maintenance in Japan is regulated- so is the sale of used 
engines for Japan domestic use. There are 4 major classifications: Class A, B, 
C, and Export. The first 3 classes are based on factors of mileage, maintenance 
records, and general condition. These engines have documentation from the 
recycling source- for reselling in Japan and are fully documented. Expect to pay 
about 25 - 50% more- if you want a certified used engine. This are available by 
special order (or check availability, occasionally we have some.<br>
<br>
The Export class- is of interest to most export markets. Engines that do not 
meet the specified criteria for the 3 classification are classified Export- they 
cannot be resold in Japan. <br>
<br>
It is important to note: just because the imported engines (from Japan) do not 
have a certificate- it does not meet the higher Japanese standards. <br>
<br>
It may mean that the recycler did not bother to have the engines certified. All 
large engine importers in the US buy the engines in bulk- what is sent is what 
they sell.<br>
<br>
We offer by special order CERTIFIED engines.<br>
