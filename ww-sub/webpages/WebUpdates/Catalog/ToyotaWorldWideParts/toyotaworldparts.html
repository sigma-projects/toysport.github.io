<p><span style="font-family: Arial">Toysport supports Toyota enthusiasts / 
owners worldwide with original Toyota parts from and for all the international 
Toyota markets.&nbsp; There are many different Toyota models sold in various versions 
throughout the world- North American, European, Asian, World Market, Oceanic, 
Japanese, and some other sub-categories.&nbsp; There is a wealth of unique market 
changes that allow you to make your vehicle, subtlety different or totally 
foreign.&nbsp; Toysport is your direct link to all these parts.<b>&nbsp;&nbsp; </b></span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial">For 
Toysport to order the correct application for these parts- we need the VIN # 
(Vehicle Identification Number) or Chassis # and Engine Type and Serial # of 
your vehicle and/or the target model.&nbsp; For alternate or conversion parts we 
still need these #s, so we can properly identify the foreign market model and 
verify the possible application and interchange.<b> </b></span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;Due to the various smog and safety 
specifications in the different world markets, Toysport cannot assume any 
liability in fitness and legality of these imported parts.</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp; 
These imported parts will be accepted for order and sold as <b>&nbsp;</b></span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: red">SPORTS 
PARTS</span><b><span style="font-family: Arial; color: blue">&nbsp; </span></b>
<span style="font-family: Arial">-that may not be used on US Public Highways.&nbsp; 
Also to prevent any issues or problems with any Toyota organization- we do not 
identify these imported parts with any Toyota Part #s.&nbsp; There is absolutely no 
warranty on these parts, from Toysport or Toyota.&nbsp; <b>We reserve the right to 
refuse any order. </b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial">Parts special ordered from the different 
international Toyota Parts Distribution centers, normally take 6-8 weeks to 
receive (<u>if the unit is in stock</u> at the foreign PDC); sometimes sooner, 
sometimes longer.&nbsp; It all depends on availability of the part, the scheduled 
shipping date, special handling required, and the method the order is shipped 
from the different international PDC warehouses.&nbsp; Ultimately, it will depend if 
TMC (Japan) has the part.<b> </b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial">The process of ordering is painstaking and 
complicated.&nbsp; It can become very expensive to process and fill an order, 
specially for parts for older (7 year and above) vehicle models.&nbsp; Our extensive 
experience and resources allow us to offer this service- but do not expect to 
save money if the part is available at your national Toyota warehouse or your 
local Toyota dealer.<b> </b></span></p>
