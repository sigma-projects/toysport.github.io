<p class="MsoBodyText2">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Tokyo — TOYOTA 
MOTOR CORPORATION (TMC) outlined a three-pillar approach to motorsports in 2002, 
focusing on its inaugural year in the FIA Formula One World Championship (F1), 
engine provision for FedEx Championship Series (CART) competitors, and support 
for various domestic and overseas activities, such as participation in the All 
Japan GT Championship.<br>
<br>
Since announcing its participation in F1 in January 1999 as a full constructor 
(developing and building its own chassis and own engine), Toyota has made 
preparations on several fronts to get its Panasonic Toyota Racing team ready for 
the first race of the season this year — the Australian Grand Prix on March 3. 
Three years of effort have included expanding and improving its facilities at 
Toyota Motorsport GmbH (TMG) in Cologne, Germany, where the team is based, and 
promoting the development of its F1 car, including performing repeated test runs 
on grand prix circuits around the world.<br>
<br>
In the CART arena, Toyota will provide engines for eight cars among five teams, 
with an eye on its first manufacturer's title. In Japan, Toyota will support 
teams participating in the All Japan GT Championship Series and the All Japan F3 
Championship Series.<br>
<br>
Aiming toward the continuous and long-term development of top-level drivers for 
the future, Toyota will push forward with its Toyota Driver Development Program, 
which it initiated last year in Japan and will expand this year overseas, 
centered on TMG.<br>
<br>
To give motorsports a more solid base, Toyota will sponsor one-make races in 
Japan, including the ESSO Formula Toyota Series and Netz Cup races (Vitz Series 
and Altezza Series), as well as support various activities in the United States, 
such as the CART Toyota Atlantic Series.<br>
<br>
This year, as in the past, Toyota's overall motorsports activities will be 
overseen by the Motorsports Division of Toyota's Higashifuji Technical Center, 
while Toyota Technocraft Co., Ltd. TRD (Japan), TRD-USA Inc. (U.S.) and TMG 
(Europe) will continue to serve as local hubs for regional engagements.</span><b><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: #333333">&nbsp;</span></b></p>
