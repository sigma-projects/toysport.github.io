<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#0000FF" face="Arial"><b><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">FYI - 3SGTE 3<sup>rd</sup> 
Generation Turbo&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><b><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">What turbo CT26? / CT20? 
/ 20B?</span></b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><b><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">The 4<sup>th</sup> 
Generation 3SGTE?&nbsp; </span></b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">If you are continuing to 
identify the turbo of a 3SGTE 3<sup>RD</sup> Generation as a Toyota CT20 or 
CT20B then you are referring to an imaginary, non-existent turbo.&nbsp; This turbo 
exists only in the Internet.&nbsp; There is NO Official Toyota reference to this 
turbo in any Toyota Manual, CD Rom, or sales literature- that we have seen, that 
uses this designation to identify the turbo as installed on the 3SGTE 3<sup>rd</sup> 
Generation engines.&nbsp; There is a REAL Toyota CT20 turbo used on the 3TGTE, 4TGTE, 
and 22RTE engines in the 80’s but this will not bolt on the 3SGTE manifolds.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">We have imported and sold 
many of ALL these engines types.&nbsp; We have ordered and sold many replacement 
turbos for the 3SGTE 3<sup>rd</sup> Generation.&nbsp; There is no casting designation 
identifying these turbos as CT20 or CT20 B.&nbsp; Many shops and individuals continue 
to sell and modify this turbo without knowing what they are handling.<b> We have 
given this information to all inquiries for this particular turbo.</b></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">There have been many 3SGTE 
Celica and MR2 owners who have been misled into buying the real CT20 turbo from 
the older turbo engines.&nbsp; The seller is 100% correct in selling them as such 
with the casting # to prove so.&nbsp; Shops and individuals who pass the CT20 as 
upgrade for the 3SGTE- do not know any better.&nbsp; The buyer must be made aware 
that if they want the real 3SGTE 3<sup>RD</sup> Generation Turbo- it is not the 
CT20 or 20B.&nbsp; NO, we have not sold any of the CT20 / 20B as upgrade or update 
for the 3SGTE engines, despite insistence from many to purchase a CT20 /20B 
based on misinformation from the internet. <b>In some </b></span><b>
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt">Toyota literature these 3SGTE 3<sup>rd</sup> 
Generation turbos are still referred to as the CT26.</span></b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">There are actually 2 
different 3SGTE 3<sup>RD</sup> Generation Turbos- #1 as installed in the 1994 - 
up Celica ST205 and MR2 SW20 vehicles the flange is similar to the CT26 but with 
a Twin Entry casting and Ceramic impellers;&nbsp; #2 as installed in the Caldina 
ST215 (and other ST2XX models) including the newest 2004 model Caldina ST246- 
the turbo center section housing is cast in one piece with the exhaust manifold, 
also with Ceramic impellers.&nbsp; Again there is no identifying models on this 
turbo.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">Also- the racing “3SGTE” 
based Toyota racing engines are not 3SGTEs- they are known internally at Toyota 
as 503- as used in IMSA, Pikes Peak, HKS drag car, and Le Mans.&nbsp; No internal or 
external parts are interchangeable.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">To prevent another 
controversy and correct widespread misinformation- the Caldina ST 215 (and other 
ST2XX models) 3SGTE should not and cannot be referred to as 3SGTE 4<sup>th</sup> 
Generation .&nbsp; The 4<sup>th</sup> Generation head supports the VVTi valve set-up 
and has direct ignition.&nbsp; The block is identical to the 3<sup>rd</sup> 
Generation. <b>There is a REAL 4<sup>th</sup> Generation 3SGE but they were not 
available with turbo.&nbsp; </b></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">Hopefully this will clarify 
the Turbo identification and the engine designation problems of the 3<sup>rd</sup> 
Generation 3SGTE.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">Thank you for your 
attention</span></font></p>
