<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">1985.&nbsp;&nbsp; Toyota could not 
do anything wrong.&nbsp; The U.S. product line was solid.&nbsp; Product for product, 
Toyota models bested offerings from all manufacturers in the important </span>
<span style="font-family: Arial">U.S.</span><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
market.&nbsp; The Corolla GTS, MR2, Celica GTS, Supra- Toyotas you were proud to 
drive. Car of the Year Awards all over the place. Then President of </span>
<span style="font-family: Arial">Toyota-&nbsp; Mr. Togo set his personal goals for 
the company, and he achieved them all before retiring.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">That same year in a talk 
with Toyota USA’s Japanese Liaison officer, discussion centered on the future of 
Toyota in the U.S.&nbsp; Trade magazines were saying that based on market projections 
Toyota was going to be surpassed by another Japanese maker in five years- he 
said ‘no, that information is inaccurate because it will happen in 3 years!’&nbsp; 
Conversation was based on total car sales only.&nbsp; It was such a strange 
prediction, that haunts today.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">By 1990, Toyota was still 
on top- if you added truck and van sales that the other manufacturer did not 
offer.&nbsp; Otherwise, the predictions by the trade magazine and the Toyota officer 
had come true.&nbsp; Then another revelation- in a visit to Japan to meet some Toyota 
people- talk was about the rapid expansion in popularity of the other Japanese 
manufacturer in the U.S.- specially in the entry-level and sporty market.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">There was a reason, they 
said – Toyota Global Ten.&nbsp; Global Ten is a Toyota corporate goal for 10% of the 
world automotive market.&nbsp; Toyota was ready to do this, but the Japanese Trade 
Ministry asked Toyota to back off: to help preserve the Japanese economy.&nbsp; At 
that time, two big car manufacturers in </span><span style="font-family: Arial">
Japan</span><span style="font-family: Arial"> were at the brink of collapse, 
which if it happened would have caused Japanese and World recession.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">In effect Toyota Japan was 
ordered to hold expansion.&nbsp; This resulted in Toyota trying to maximize 
profit on model lines and unit sales.&nbsp; There was less emphasis on 
entry-level, low margin vehicles.&nbsp; In the European markets, this worked 
well since the image Toyota was trying to project was for world-class products.&nbsp; 
In the U.S. the Turbo Supra and MR2 were offered to the enthusiasts- also best 
in class.&nbsp; The entry of Lexus was a very bright spotlight for Toyota, which 
further dimmed the product line weakness in the entry-level field.&nbsp; The 
other Japanese manufacturer continued introducing better entry-level and sporty 
units. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">By 1995, Toyota was still 
on top of all Imports.&nbsp; Lexus continued to shine, forcing Europeans to 
reposition and reinvent their stars, but the Toyota entry models was headed the 
other direction.&nbsp; In the U.S., magazine surveys also showed the different Toyota 
models became also-rans. The “other” Japanese manufacturer had entrenched on the 
entry-level market firmly.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">In another Japan visit, 
this issue was discussed again.&nbsp; Yes, Toyota Corporate in Japan is aware of 
the U.S. condition, and yes they have formed a group to address this problem. 
But other business interests were more crucial for Toyotas future- 
communication, construction, and aviation.&nbsp; And in Japan- the “other” 
Japanese manufacturer did not matter, even in the popular Tokyo Auto Salon show.&nbsp; 
There were hardly any of their products on display.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">The last 5 years into 
2000, was very good for Toyota and Lexus.&nbsp; Record profits and market share.&nbsp; The 
New Millennium however called for a total Toyota corporate review and 
redirection.&nbsp; It is not too late.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">1985 seemed like a good 
year. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Toyota, specially in the 
U.S., has not lost it’s following. They still buy Toyotas to fill the record 
books.&nbsp; What Toyota has lost however, is a generation of people interested in 
CARS (and bringing their cars to places like Toysport).&nbsp; Cars that are the best 
in their class.&nbsp; Cars with state-of-the art engines.&nbsp; Cars you are proud to 
drive.&nbsp; Cars you can have fun in.&nbsp; And can afford (and still visit Toysport).&nbsp; 
HINT: Not goofy, radical ads, for weird cars!&nbsp; It heightens the shallowness of 
the product.&nbsp;&nbsp; Talk to the original owners of the 85 cars.&nbsp; Talk to current 
owners of the 85 cars.&nbsp; Do not be afraid of a little oil and grease.&nbsp; Smell the 
exhaust.&nbsp; </span></p>
