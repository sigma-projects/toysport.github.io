<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">The Toyota Starlet was the most 
  basic car Toyota ever imported to the U.S.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>When it was introduced in 1981, TRD USA tried to initiate the 
  U.S. Starlet Challenge, patterned after the popular Japanese Starlet Cup series 
  for the entry-level motorsport.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Toysport 
  prepared 2 spec cars- with full TRD suspension, body kit, wheels, and engine 
  kits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>TRD prepared 2 cars to SCCA 
  GT3 race specs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>SCCA was interested 
  in adding the series and these cars to their events, but Toyota U.S.A.’s marketing 
  arm did not agree on converting their basic car into a racing machine, an “image 
  problem” they said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>End of story.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>This Starlet is the remnant of what could have been a very popular and 
  affordable series for Toyota.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This 
  car is all original TRD -except for the engine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>A potent 4AGE Corolla unit with turbocharged replaced the K series engine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>An HKS 5AG (not an official Toyota designation) engine kit was upgraded 
  with Toysport forged pistons, a stainless turbo manifold, and Turbonetics T3 
  Super 60 turbo.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>This conversion kit remains one of the most popular kits from 
  Toysport.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The full-line HKS electronic 
  turbo upgrades are installed, of course.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>All the original TRD Starlet Cup pieces are on the car- from the steering 
  wheel to the wheels, front spoiler to the rear wing, fender flares, race seats, 
  roll cage, gig brakes, gymkhana suspension even the Japanese fender mirrors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>It took more than 5 years to collect all the correct pieces.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>In these days of modified Hondas- this Starlet shows what Toyotas were 
  twenty years ago and Toysport was way ahead of the import-tuning trend!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman; color: black">&nbsp;</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman; color: blue"><o:p>
