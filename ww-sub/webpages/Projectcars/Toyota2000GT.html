        Toyota 2000GT</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">The 2000GT remains the ultimate 
  Toyota to have.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Toysport has helped 
  several 2000 GT owners- from getting trim bezels for the headlights (all hand 
  made), steering wheels, exhaust systems, dash-pad covers, Mikuni carburator 
  pieces, and even engine bearings. In fact we have maintained contact with Toyota’s 
  original Tokyo area mechanic, who was directly in-charge for all 2000 GTs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>For several years he was based at TRD USA when TRD opened shop in Gardena.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Working on these cars is difficult because of parts availability; 
  even just adjusting the triple Mikuni carburetors becomes difficult because 
  you have to lean over, very very low, and not touch the delicate body.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>It is a good thing they are Toyotas trouble-free and require minimum 
  maintenance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 2000GT we maintain 
  is in immaculate shape.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It is better than the two units Toyota USA has in their Museum.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The head is currently apart, waiting for camshaft bearings……unfortunately 
  unavailable anywhere…….but maybe someone out there will read this and…….on the 
  other hand a nice 1GGE will fit in easy- will have the same 2000cc. And a new 
  24 valve set-up…….no, this Toyota you do not modify!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>This one you admire.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">If you are not familiar with 
  the Toyota 2000GT, you can see the only convertible version in action, appearing 
  in the 007 James Bond Film, &quot;You Only Live Twice.&quot; </font> <b><o:p> </o:p>
