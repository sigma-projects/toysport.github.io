        <h1><font size="4">Celica ST185 WRC 3SGE 3<sup>rd</sup> Gen 260HP (CALDINA)
        </font> </h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">The Celica ST 205 series got the 
upgraded 3SGTE 3<sup>rd</sup> Gen engines when they were introduced in 1994.&nbsp; 
This model and engine never made it to the U.S.&nbsp; The 3SGTE engines were 
discontinued in the U.S. in 1995, in the MR2s.&nbsp; The U.S. 3SGTEs in the St185 and 
MR2 turbos were the 2<sup>nd</sup> Gen type.&nbsp; The 3<sup>rd</sup> Gen 3SGTE turbo 
engines continued to be available, in Japan and the rest of the world.&nbsp; As 
installed in the Caldina, the 3SGTE had a new direct fire ignition like the 
2JZGTEs and a new turbo.&nbsp; The turbo housing is cast as one piece including the 
exhaust manifold.&nbsp; (See related article about the CT26 as installed in the 3SGTE 
3rd Gen engines).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">The 3SGTE 3<sup>rd</sup> Gen engine as 
used in the Caldina was rated at 260 HP.&nbsp; This cannot be called a 4<sup>th </sup>
Gen since the head is non-VVTi.&nbsp; The 3<sup>rd</sup> Gen 3SGTE was introduced 
with ”shim under bucket” head set-up.&nbsp; This allows radical cam upgrades without 
the danger of the adjustment shims flying off.&nbsp; It also has a reinforced lower 
block with an aluminum stiffener extension and a smaller regular oil pan.&nbsp; The 
timing components in front are totally different and will not interchange with 
earlier models,&nbsp; so if you need a 3<sup>rd</sup> Gen- you need all the correct 
parts.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">We meet a lot of ‘strange customers” at 
Toysport and this one almost tops the other more “obsessive compulsive” types.&nbsp; 
Step-by-step photos, all original parts if possible (no modifications), and 
please “air freight everything……..”&nbsp; His bill was over $15,000- the most 
expensive stock engine install we have ever done.&nbsp; Yes everything was brand 
new.&nbsp;&nbsp; We anticipated a lot of demand for this Caldina engine and imported a 
couple of the units….&nbsp; for a lot less….&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">We tried to sell a front mount 
intercooler installed and an HKS Hyper exhaust, but was voted down…&nbsp; he wanted 
all original sheet metal and stock exhaust looking tips !!&nbsp; We managed to talk 
him into a WRC front bumper though.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">The brackets are mostly similar, but 
carry different part #s…. and the engine needed massaging to fit.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
cross-member had to be modified to clear the oil pan, and the intercooler needed 
to be lowered 2 inches to clear the engine hood.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">We ordered new wiring harnesses- engine 
harness #1 and #2- to keep with the owner demands of authenticity.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Rewiring was more involved than 
anticipated.&nbsp; The fuse box wiring is not on the engine harness.&nbsp; The connectors 
to the ECU were different, Japan only issues. After a lot of help from Toyota 
Overseas support division and the Toyota Technical Center, everything was put 
together, even looks factory!&nbsp; The only way we do conversions here at Toysport.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">This ST185 was actually a new purchase!&nbsp; 
It had superficial fender and bumper damage.&nbsp; The steering rack and axles were 
rebuilt.&nbsp; The owner is changing colors, so the entire engine bay was stripped, 
down to the last bolt and clamp.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">For good measure all bolts were new or 
re-anodized.</font></p>
