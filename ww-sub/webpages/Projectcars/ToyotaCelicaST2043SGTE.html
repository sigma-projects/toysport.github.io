        <h1><font size="4">Celica ST 204 3SGTE 3<sup>th</sup> Gen (245 HP)</font></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Our plan was ambitious.&nbsp; We had a 
complete Celica ST205 roll-over chassis from Japan.&nbsp; And we just received an 
almost new 9483 mile ST204 Celica GTS.&nbsp; We ordered new ST205 panels (hood and 
bumper), projector lights and GT4 high wing, taillights too.&nbsp; We were going to 
build a RHD full spec 1999 ST205.&nbsp; We wanted real ST205- with the big brakes and 
all….&nbsp; Can’t be done without reflooring (reframing?) the whole back frame of the 
car, and the ST205 donor we had was slightly tweaked on that department. </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">So we ended with just an engine swap.&nbsp; 
The water intercooler was substituted for a front mount air to air – shows off 
great with the WRC bumper.&nbsp; A 3SGE transmission was used instead of the 5SFE 5 
speed, for gearing considerations.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Engine brackets had to be imported from 
Japan (but in a bind modifying ST185 brackets will work, for those attempting 
this conversion.&nbsp; We ordered a European RHD engine harness, just to keep the car 
all-original.&nbsp; Rewiring was similar to ST180 conversions with the 3SGTE 
engines.&nbsp; We finished the conversion with a real 180 MPH speedometer – a part we 
did not know existed until a customer ordered one!</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">This conversion took almost a year and a 
half to finish.&nbsp; Since this was a Toysport vehicle, parts installed were usually 
resold when some customers, needed the parts for the same project “right away”.&nbsp; 
From our estimate at least 6 conversions were finished by our customers from 
parts imported and fitted for this project.&nbsp; This is why project cars are 
important to us.&nbsp; Hands on experience.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Performance was identical to a ST185 
with the same mods- front intercooler and 3” exhaust.&nbsp; The body in this 
generation was more rigid- and this was noticeable compared to other ST185s or 
ST184 3SGTE conversions we have done.&nbsp; The lack of rear drive train components 
(weight savings) made this car an excellent performer, just like the other Front 
wheel drivers with the 3SGTEs.&nbsp; The ST205 front brakes were not a bolt-on so we 
kept them off this conversion.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">The ST200 body is so much better than 
the previous generations.&nbsp; The chassis is more rigid and the interior a lot 
roomier- and the suspension so much improved over previous generations.&nbsp; You got 
to put a 3SGTE in your ST204!</font></p>
