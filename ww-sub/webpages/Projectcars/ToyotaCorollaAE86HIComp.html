<h1><b><font face="Arial" color="blue" size="4">
Corolla AE86 HI-Comp</font></b></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Powering the AE86 is the venerable and 
potent 4AGE.&nbsp; In its original form, the engine came with a TVIS system.&nbsp; This 
vacuum actuated intake system bridged the gap between high out-put and good 
throttle response.&nbsp; Ingeniously, Toyota speeded up air flow to the cylinders by 
making an 8 port intake runner-&nbsp; 4 of which can be shut-off at low throttle 
position.&nbsp; The purpose of this is to give good throttle response at low end 
without sacrificing top end potential.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
With the resurgent interest in these cars- high 
mileage units are being updated to the later model 4 port Hi-Compression 
engines.&nbsp; The later model 4AGEs also come with upgraded crankshafts and rods…and 
most important higher compression.&nbsp; This newer engine had enough compression to 
get by without the TVIS- but use smaller ports instead.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
Here lies the dilemma….the TVIS head is considered 
by many misguided people as a restriction to performance.&nbsp; IT IS NOT.&nbsp; The TVIS 
serves a very important purpose and should be retained.&nbsp; Combining the 
advantages of the Hi-Comp late model block with the TVIS head is the ultimate 
low-cost, high value engine set-up for the AE86.&nbsp; Stays smog legal too!!&nbsp; Since 
the Hi-Comp engines were all FWD applications- fitting into a RWD application is 
as simple as reusing all the water-pump and hose connectors from the original 
engine.&nbsp; All original engine harness and accessories transfer over.&nbsp; The only 
electrical modification is splicing the new injector leads to the old harness.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
Using the TVIS head is highly recommended, but low 
budget conversions can use the small port head- if the intake is reoriented to 
the front.&nbsp; This is a complicated cut and weld affair.&nbsp; The original and new 
(engine) manifold are cut-up and pieced together.&nbsp; It has to be done right or 
there will be a dent on the hood the first time you shut it and/or wrong vacuum 
connections.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
(On this particular car the small port head is 
used with the modified manifold, because the original TVIS head is being fully 
prepared with big valves, porting, and cams.)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
The late small port 4AGE runs very well in the 
AE86, even with just the modified intake manifold.&nbsp; The latter retro-fittment 
with the upgraded TVIS head will further enhance low-end response and high RPM 
performance. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
Many different engine upgrades is the reason why 
the AE86s remain so popular.&nbsp; There are many ways to set-up an engine: you can 
do it a step at a time- as budget allows or just go one stop all-out.&nbsp; Like the 
early Celicas and Corollas….this model is a keeper. </font></p>
