        <h1><font size="4">MR2 SW20 3SGE 4<sup>th</sup> Gen VVTi</font></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">The SW20 MR2s were discontinued in the 
U.S. in 1995.&nbsp; In Japan and the rest of the world, Toyota continued to upgrade 
and sell the MR2s until 1999.&nbsp; The 3<sup>rd</sup> Gen 3SGTE turbo engine 
continued to be available, and in 1997 the 4<sup>th</sup> Gen 3SGE VVTi Beams 
engine was introduced with 200HP, equal to the U.S. 3SGTE engine in the MR2s 
(although HP count in Japan is a measured a little bit different).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">The 4<sup>th</sup> Gen VVTi is the 
latest and newest 3SGE, together with the Altezza Dual VVTi 3SGE.&nbsp; Since the 
Altezza was RWD it was a hard install on the MR2s and Celicas- but the single 
VVTi is a true drop-in, with the correct brackets.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">We had just received 2 brand new engines 
from Toyota and wanted to see what it would be like.&nbsp; Naturally- we had to 
install one at first opportunity.&nbsp; Fortunately we did not have to wait too long, 
there came an MR2 NA with 180,000 miles whose owner was wary of turbo engines.&nbsp; 
For this install we used a header with built-in dual catalytic converters (for 
1-4 and 2-3) to see if it will pass California’s strict emission standards; we 
have not done it yet- but- it has provisions casted in the head to fit in an EGR 
and meet the U.S&gt; Federal emission requirement.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">We ordered the engine harness from Japan 
for the VVTi engine and the only problem we encountered were the connectors to 
the chassis harness.&nbsp; No problem until we found out how difficult it was to 
identify and order the connectors.&nbsp; They are different- available Japan only.&nbsp; 
(We will supply these connectors if you decide you need this engine too.)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Power delivery and throttle response is 
unbelievable- reaffirming our belief that Toyota still is the leader on any 
Twin-Cam technology.&nbsp; Although a little late in offering the variable-timing cam 
technology- Toyota has delivered the best available in the market- thank you 
YAMAHA!!&nbsp; (We were losing faith there for a little while.)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Aside from the special exhaust manifold, 
we fabricated a connector to an HKS turbo muffler- a little bit loud, but we 
wanted absolutely no power restriction on this end.&nbsp; Naturally we upgraded the 
shocks and springs- Eibach and Tokico Illuminas, still the best all around 
suspension set-up.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">A lot of our project cars are based on 
installing JDM specification engines in older Toyota models, and this proves to 
be one of the easier and most rewarding ones.&nbsp; You cannot beat the factory in 
tuning engines, you just have to wait when they become available in the HP range 
you want.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">We plan further tuning of this engine 
combination with cams and other electrical gizmos….&nbsp; maybe a 2200cc version too… 
So that the MR2 NA crowd will be able to run and play- “all engine”…… stay in 
tune</font></p>
