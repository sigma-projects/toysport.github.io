  <h1><font size="4">Lexus SC300 2JZGTE </font></h1>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">A high-mileage SC300 
  with a still healthy engine came in needing help.&nbsp; Naturally, the owner- a 
  physical fitness trainer wanted a better engine, before the old one died- but 
  wanted a street-legal conversion.&nbsp; Green and healthy.&nbsp; We also happened to 
  have available a 95 Supra 2JZGTE U.S. Spec engine (3000 miles) that had been 
  waiting for an SC300 or GS300 body.&nbsp; (Note: GS300 owners read the GS300 
  article.)&nbsp; This straightforward conversion was something we had been wanting 
  to do.&nbsp; The 2JZGTE is the factory upgrade engine for the Toyota SOARER in 
  Japan (aka- SC300 in the U.S.)&nbsp; </font> </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">What was really 
  interesting about this project was how the owner and car (with the Twin Turbo 
  power) were perfect for each other.&nbsp; It is funny how cars tend to acquire the 
  characteristic of it’s owner, and/or how an owner eventually begins acting 
  like his car.&nbsp; The 2JZGTE was a natural choice for car and owner in this 
  case.&nbsp; He wanted stock power and NO upgrades.&nbsp; Basically he wanted a Turbo 
  Soarer- a car anybody in Japan could buy.&nbsp; Toysport was happy to indulge 
  him- and no we could not talk to him for any upgrades.&nbsp; Lean and mean.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">The engine swap was 
  straightforward- after the correct mounts and oil pan were identified.&nbsp; All 
  the US emission parts, down to the catalytic converter were replaced with the 
  correct Supra pieces- this car is street legal!&nbsp; All diagnostic hook-ups work 
  too.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">The stock non-turbo 5 
  speed tranny was retained with an upgraded clutch set-up.&nbsp; No he did not want 
  the 6 speed.&nbsp; Traction Control was also by-passed.&nbsp; Exhaust upgrade consisted 
  of a Greddy exhaust and HKS downpipe.&nbsp; An HKS intercooler was special ordered 
  for this application.&nbsp; A Supra engine harness adapts perfectly to the original 
  factory wiring, with some rewiring to interface with the dash.&nbsp; Only some 
  fabrication for the intercooler ducting was needed.&nbsp; An HKS EVC IV, Turbo 
  Timer, and HKS TwinPower were the only electronic add-ons.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">We spent more time 
  working out the AC and heater problems- that the car originally had (before 
  the engine conversion).&nbsp; IMPORTANT LESSON- a flood damaged car will have many 
  and expensive electrical problems.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">With the engine happy 
  and potent- we decided to slightly tweak the body too- much like muscle toning 
  or sculpting.&nbsp; A Bomex&nbsp; body kit was installed- less the rear spoiler.&nbsp; The 
  front spoiler was modified to incorporate the grille on the later SC.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">The car is unbelievably 
  fast but easy to drive.&nbsp; Since the gearing was kept all original, (the drive 
  train was geared for 200HP not 330)- and the engine just accelerates, even 
  short shifting- there is tremendous torque.&nbsp; The car feels 1000lbs. lighter.&nbsp; 
  An original Soarer with the turbo engine will not be as fast and fun!</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">A really motivated Lexus 
  SC for a really motivating physical fitness trainer.&nbsp; The only question left 
  now is when, not if- the owner will start acting funny……oh, he also asked us 
  to put weights on our phones- the only exercise we get…….</font></span></p>
