        Corolla AE86 3T-GTE </font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial" size="2">As people were busy learning/discovering 
  and starting to modify their New 4AG Corollas, Toysport decided to extend a 
  tradition that Toyota abandoned- the well-respected and beloved T series engine 
  in the high performance Corollas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To 
  make this a factory-possible conversion (all original Toyota)- it was a natural 
  choice to install the latest generation TG engine- the 3TGTE (1800cc., factory 
  turbo, twin sparkplug).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This car 
  was 1 of the first 5 Corolla AE86 imported for press/prototype in the U.S. Modifications 
  included a Levin front-end with full Pittura body kit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>This allowed a large HKS intercooler to fit up front.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The standard transmission was left in, with close-ratio gears to take 
  full advantage of the higher HP and torque.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The rear end was fitted with a TRD LSD and 3.7 gears.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Suspension was by Eibach with Tokiko PRO-Drag shocks. The full HKS turbo 
  upgrades were used- EVC, F-Con, SBC, IPM, EGC, GCC II, AIC, Twin-Power.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Toysport parts were 2000cc. pistons, Carillo rods, upgraded 
  CT20 Turbo, modified Centerforce Dual Friction, and of course a brake up-grade 
  with an adjustable proportioning valve.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>This car was first displayed in the 1986 Toyota Long Beach Grand Prix, 
  and all electronic shows.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(Kenwood 
  sponsored the car with over 300 pounds of audio equipment, that was conveniently 
  installed and uninstalled between Sound-Offs!!) Double-Duty.</font></p>
