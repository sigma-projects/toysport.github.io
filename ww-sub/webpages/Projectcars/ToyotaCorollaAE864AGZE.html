<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="color: windowtext">The 
  4AGZE is a very popular upgrade to the Corolla RWD and FWD.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The Corolla AE86 was a popular car when introduced in 85.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>A cult like following in the U.S. developed, in defiance to FWD.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>This was followed by a recent boom in Japan, for “drifters” and the heroics 
  of a Corolla in the popular cartoon series Initial D.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The MR2 Supercharged engine was a natural upgrade, as it was factory 
  installed on next generation sporty FWD Corollas in Japan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The conversion is straight forward, after the engine is reoriented to 
  RWD configuration. Engine management is with the original Japan Spec ECU.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>We tried to keep everything as authentic as possible in the engine configuration, 
  with an HKS Twin-Power being the only upgrade.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span>A front mounted Supra intercooler was used to improve efficiency, as 
  the original set-up works more like an interwarmer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Thorley headers and an HKS Hyper exhaust (a special HKS import by Toysport) 
  completed the exhaust package.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Suspension 
  was converted to coil-overs (front) with offset blocks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Further adjustability is through Cusco Camber plates and Tokico 5-way 
  adjustable Illuminas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A KAAZ LSD 
  unit replaced the factory LSD, since torque output exceeded the factory unit’s 
  ability to function consistently, and to allow the driver maximum control.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Lightweight RACE ONLY Panasport (14X6) with </span><span style="color: black">Bridgestone 
  RE710 Kai , 195/50-14</span><span style="color: red"> </span><span style="color: windowtext"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>tires.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>This car was popular and active in L.A. Region SCCA Solo events.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Like many excellent Corolla in Los Angeles this car went back to Japan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Ice to the Eskimo. </span></font></p>
