<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial" size="2">The 20 VALVE 4AG was the latest 
  and last version of the very popular engine series.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>This engine replaced the 4AGZ, and showed the world that at least in 
  Japan and some world markets- the Toyota TwinCam legacy was alive. Of course, 
  it was also a natural to install this powerunit into the last generation Corolla 
  RWD.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The engine had to be reoriented 
  to RWD configuration and the firewall modified to clear the distributor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>(There are other options in setting up the ignition and fuel injection 
  system, that can make for a tidier install, but the plan on this project was 
  to use as much factory spec parts as possible.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Suspension is set with TRD springs, adjustable shocks, and suspension 
  bushings- in keeping with the factory original theme.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>In fact TRD Japan has set-up a car exactly like this- with some mods 
  on the ECU and camshafts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Panasport 
  15X7<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>are used with Yokohama Grand Prix M7R, 205/45-15 tires.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Custom headers (in the same configuration of similar RWD 4Ags) with an 
  HKS Dragger<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(a special HKS import 
  by Toysport) finish this Japanese Spec set-up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The last new 5AG HKS kit (with ultra-lightweight Toysport 20-Valve pistons) 
  and full internal upgrades is planned for this project- making this the ultimate 
  naturally aspirated Corolla in the U.S. This is a work in progress as we wait 
  upgrading the body panels into the latest version of the Corolla RWD model from 
  Japan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A work in progress.</font></p>
