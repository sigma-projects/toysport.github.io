<p><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial" size="2">The 1ZZFE and 2ZZGE are Toyota’s 
  latest 4 cylinder engines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Both 
  are all –aluminum 1800cc 16-valve engines with variable cam timing, matching 
  the current offerings of other manufacturers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>This is Toyota’s first all aluminum 4 cylinder block.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The 1ZZFE introduced in 1988, without variable cam timing- was updated 
  with VVT, when the 2ZZFE debuted in 2000.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The 2ZZGE- was further enhanced with a variable lift feature.<o:p> </o:p> 
  </font></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US"> <font face="Arial" size="2"> The variable cam timing feature 
  addresses the problem associated with the old FE engines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>(Please read the separate notes in the TECH Section.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Without VVT, the old engines seemed to run abruptly out of breathe- a 
  function of their smooth power delivery that promised “more”- but hit a performance 
  wall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The VVT 1ZZFE and VVTi 2ZZGE- 
  now have the performance surge to satisfy the driver.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>(Of course people will still want more, which is why Toysport is in business.)<o:p> 
  </o:p> </font></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US"> <font face="Arial" size="2"> It is very interesting to 
  note the difference between the two engines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The 1ZZFE and 2ZZGE are of the same displacement, but their bore and 
  stroke are different.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 1ZZFE 
  “izzy” with the FE head is the quick response, high torque model- has a longer 
  stroke ratio, to further improve the torque characteristic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The 2ZZGE “duzzy” with the sports type GE head is the high RPM, higher 
  HP unit- with a square bore / stroke ratio.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>This allows it to rev and deliver power in the higher RPM range.<o:p> 
  </o:p> </font></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US"> <font face="Arial" size="2"> The driving characteristic 
  of both engines are dramatically evident.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>In the 2000 Celica, where both engines are offered- the GT with the 1ZZFE 
  is easier and smoother to drive- more responsive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The GTS with the 2ZZGE starts of lazier, and need lots of pedal- but 
  ultimately more HP.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Which is a 
  good contrast- drivers now know the trade-off between drivability and horsepower.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>A lot of people who tested the cars opted for the more responsive 
  GT model, although they were initially looking for power.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span>The power band characteristic of the two engines offer a good choice- 
  chooses which is more important.<o:p> </o:p> </font></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US"> <font face="Arial" size="2"> A recurring question- why 
  did the MRS end with the 1ZZFE?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Overall, 
  the 1ZZFE was more compatible to the overall concept.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The 2ZZGE would need more attention driving (to extract the power)- detracting 
  from the fun aspect of cruising.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For 
  diehards- yes we can do the 2ZZGE conversion.<o:p> </o:p> </font></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US"> <font face="Arial" size="2"> From Toyota’s early pioneering 
  Twin Cams, to the succeeding multi-valve DOHC engines, to this new generation 
  of variable cam timing and lift units…..Toyota continues to be the world’s largest 
  Twin Cam manufacturer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As 
  a review: Toyota Twin Cams have seen it all- 2, 4, and 5 valves; four, six, 
  eight, twelve cylinders; normally aspirated, supercharged, turbo, and twin-turbo; 
  gas, propane, and diesel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>TVIS, 
  non-TVIS, and individual throttle bodies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Been there, done that.<o:p> </o:p></font></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Arial" size="2">The aluminum block is hefty 
  and casted really clean.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It will 
  allow the engine to produce massive horsepower over stock.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Dimensionally they are bigger than the 4AGE, the engine family it is 
  superceding.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Block strengthening 
  is possible, by pinning the cylinders to stabilize the bores.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The crank is a lightweight design and so are the rods.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The crank and rods are casted really well, stress-relief and shot-peen- 
  will produce parts that look forged. <o:p> </o:p> </font></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US"> <font face="Arial" size="2"> The 2ZZGE has problems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Bent valves from missed shifts have been common.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Sticking valve mechanism also cause unscheduled visits to the Toyota 
  Dealers.<o:p> </o:p> </font></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US"> <font face="Arial" size="2"> Toyota is addressing these 
  problems currently.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We have forged 
  pistons in stock and .5mm os available with deeper valve reliefs and a .5 higher 
  compression.<o:p> </o:p></font></span></p>
