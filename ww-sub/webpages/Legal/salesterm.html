The entire risk of quality and performance of sports parts is with the buyer. It 
is the purchaser/competitor’s responsibility to inspect and verify the 
dimensions of all parts prior to installation. Should such parts prove defective 
following their purchase, the buyer, and not the manufacturer, distributor, or 
retailer, assumes the entire cost of all necessary services or repair. The 
vehicle manufacturers warranties are voided if the vehicle or sports part is 
used for competition or if they fail as a result of modification.</span></font></p>
