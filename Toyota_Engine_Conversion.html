<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">All Toyota cars and trucks have always been excellent 
candidates for engine upgrades.&nbsp; This is the reason <b>import enthusiasts</b> 
have previously modified more Toyotas than any other brand. Just as other import 
owners are now finding out- complete engine upgrade and interchangeability is 
the sure way to higher performance and reliable power.&nbsp; For Toyota the choice of 
engines is much larger- in terms of models and variations.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">After all the bolt-on equipment have failed to amuse or 
meet the performance expectations- there remain unlimited ways to raise 
performance levels through an all-engine build-up, complete engine transplant, 
or forced induction modifications.&nbsp; For ultimate set-ups all three options are 
sometimes used on the same package.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">A successful conversion starts with research.&nbsp; Although 
there is a lot of information available from the internet, import magazines, and 
from bench-racing friends: some information is less accurate than others, there 
is a lot of misinformation, and some totally misdirected opinions.&nbsp; Qualify the 
source- beware of experts basing experience on a one time conversion, magazine 
articles are usually 60% accurate, and friends maybe even less so.&nbsp; Research is 
important, but real experience trumps all printed media and talk.&nbsp; Find a shop 
willing and able to do conversions, and expect most shops to “pass” on the job.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">There are accurate step by step articles available from 
many websites, try and contact the site with questions- this way you will know 
if they are able to answer questions and support your project, if you decide to 
do a similar set-up.&nbsp; Just keep in mind that the Toyota dealer will not know 
how, TRD will not answer any questions, your friends may know even less.&nbsp; Some 
information will remain proprietary.&nbsp; Toysport will support your project, if 
parts are purchased here.&nbsp; We will provide general information and some limited 
instructions- but do not expect a step-by step, wire by wire installation guide<span style="font-size: 11.0pt">.&nbsp; 
Get a Factory Workshop Manual and the correct Electrical Wiring Diagram.&nbsp; </span>
If you have any doubts-&nbsp; <b>DO NOT ATTEMPT </b>any modification or conversion.

<h1>Choosing a Set-Up</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">The three major ways to power are (1) complete all-engine 
build-up, (2) engine transplant, or (3) forced induction.&nbsp; These of course may 
be combined or all incorporated in the engine set-up you decide on.</font></p>
<h1>Choosing an engine</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Try to stay with the same engine family.&nbsp; If the block is 
the same family, mounting will be a lot easier.&nbsp; For example the Toyota A 
engines are available in at least 6 different versions.&nbsp; Engines will retrofit 
each other with just water connection or oil pan changes.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Try optional factory engines in the same chassis.&nbsp; For 
example the Toyota Celica had multiple engine variations thru the entire model 
run.&nbsp; Stay more or less within the same generation, FWD or RWD.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">As a rule- the engine has to be matched with the correct 
engine harness, ECU, and all EFI related switches and sensor.&nbsp; Since engines 
maybe coming from a different chassis, be prepared to interface some wires to 
the chassis harness on your car.&nbsp; Most parts coming from Japan have a different 
wiring layout; so figure rerouting and cutting and extending some wires to 
properly locate components, specially the ECU.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">All Japanese Specification engines (JDM) will not meet US 
Smog Requirements; they have no EGR- although it will pass Emissions standards 
in a tailpipe test.&nbsp; Some engines can be retrofitted with the EGR, some cannot.&nbsp; 
Toysport sells all Japanese imported engines as SPORTS PARTS (please read the 
NOTICE).</font></p>
