<p><font size="3">For many of our customers, a visit to Toysport is a surprise 
  part of a vacation. Families from around the world come to visit the many sites 
  of Southern California, and frequently the Toyota diehard in the family- manages 
  to squeeze in time to visit our showroom and facility (the whole family in tow). 
  Business people too, often schedule meetings with enough free time to drop by. 
  Even Toyota personnel from the different Regional offices, in town for official 
  (Toyota) national headquarters business, regularly visit to see what’s new. 
  On long weekends, visitors drive-in from out-of-town. Race weekends bring car 
  clubs and motorsports enthusiasts to continue bench-racing while visiting and 
  checking out the cars and parts.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">We have not disappointed our visitors- judging by their excited 
  reaction when they see the most comprehensive display of Toyota sports parts. 
  Some Toyota items that only we have, make the visit totally worthwhile. Often, 
  new inquiries and old questions are answered by a simple visit. Just like a 
  tour destination (&quot;tourist trap&quot;)- Toyota curios, gadgets, engines, 
  accessories, and hardware are here to view, hold, examine, compare, and (hopefully!) 
  purchase. Often, Toysport is the first and last stop of the LA visit- first 
  to order parts and then to pick-up on the way home. Often too, the visit is 
  to meet the face of the voice on the phone or behind the e-mail address.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">There is nothing like Toysport, if you are a Toyota enthusiast. 
  We are true Toyotaphiles. We enjoy and pamper our Toyotas. We are dedicated 
  to making your Toyota, into the best Toyota. Like you, we are Toyota obsessed.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">There is nothing that will replace a &quot;brick and mortar&quot; 
  business. In this age of e-commerce, did you ever wonder how many businesses 
  actually stock and know the products? You can never develop know-how and experience 
  without actually installing, using, testing, and evaluating the products. Talk 
  is cheap and easy. Naturally, some information we have will to remain proprietary. 
  Some sites in &quot;cyberspace&quot;, claim a lot of experience. Some sites 
  have a lot of information and misinformation. In Toysport, it is accurate and 
  real.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Most of the articles on this website are presented in a conversational 
  tone. We tried to keep it brief and interesting. The aim is to inform and is 
  not meant to be instructional. We try to recreate an actual visit.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Before you proceed please take a minute to read our ONLINE WEBSITE 
  POLICY and other LEGAL NOTICES.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The biggest challenge of maintaining 
  this website is updating the parts lists and providing pictures. We apologize 
  for the long delays and late updates. Instead of waiting and collating the lists 
  continuously (for a fully developed site), we have decided to do incremental 
  updates. We hope that the new scheduled and regular updates will address parts 
  availability inquiries sent by e-mail and also, and finally meet the many requests 
  for product pictures.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many of you have been very patient 
  (Thank you!) and for this reason, we are offering a tremendous assortment of 
  parts on <b><a href="Specials.html">SPECIAL SALE</a></b>. Tell your friends.

  Things About Toysport</font></a></font></strong><font size="3"><b><br>
  </b><br>
  </font><font face="Arial"><font size="3">In 1980 Toysport was established to 
  distribute Toyota Racing Development (TRD) sport parts. Working as in-house 
  consultant for TRD USA, Toysport initiated the &quot;grass-root&quot; support 
  program for Toyota racers. The program evolved into Toyota's Contingency Program, 
  when Toyota USA formed Toyota Motorsport in 1981. Ever since the beginning Toysport 
  has actively supported Toyota USA's corporate goals and the Toyota enthusiasts’ 
  needs.<br>
  <br>
  Team Toysport America Limited was incorporated in 1982. Toysport continues to 
  supplement and complement the activities of Toyota Motorsport and TRD USA. Toysport 
  handled vehicle preparation for Toyota shows and events. Toysport also prepared 
  all magazine cars for TRD USA and Toyota Public Relations.</font></font></p>
<font face="Arial">
        <p><font size="3">Overseas, the principals of Toysport have worked with TOYOTA (Japan)
        since 1965, and TOSCO (the original corporate name of TRD (Japan) since
        1972. The relationship continues into the next millennium.<br>
        <br>
        The initial thrust of Toysport was engine development and accessory
        distribution. Working with &quot;grassroots&quot; Toyota racing teams
        and U.S. aftermarket parts manufacturers allowed Toysport to be in the
        center of parts development and competition preparation. Toysport's
        commitment to Toyota racers and enthusiasts was total and encompassing.
        This commitment earned us the continued cooperation of TOYOTA, TRD (Technocraft),
        TRD USA, the aftermarket manufacturers and importers. Toysport has
        worked continually in expanding and developing our product lines.
        Affiliated businesses have also responded to our needs by adding and
        supplementing our product lines on a continuing basis. This evolved into
        Toysport becoming the leading Toyota Tuning Specialist and Warehouse
        Distributor for Toyota sports parts.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">In1985 Toysport had achieved the highest level of product and
        technical support for Toyota enthusiasts. From the leading winners in
        Toyota's contingency program to the top Toyota Racing Teams worldwide (TOM's
        Racing and TRUST of Japan), Toysport was actively involved in Motorsport
        activities. Our customers were entered in various SCCA, IMSA, SCORE and
        HDRA events. Our customers have won National championships for Toyota.
        Toysport entered international FIA sanctioned events and always placed
        in the top two positions in their classes, a perfect record. Multiple
        race track records were also set in the U.S.<br>
        <br>
        Attention away from Motorsport activities was a result of the tremendous
        business in the Toyota aftermarket. 1985 and 1986 model years saw the
        strongest Toyota sports model line-up in U.S. Toyota history. This
        started in 1972 with the Celica and SR5 Corollas, both milestone cars.
        The Toyota 4X4 Truck business started in 1979 added to the frenzy. The
        introduction of the 3rd generation Celica GTS and Supra in 1982 greatly
        expanded the business. The arrival of the Twin Cam Corollas and MR2 in
        1985 was followed by Turbo models- Toyota enthusiasts were abundant, and
        Toysport was THE SOURCE.<br>
        <br>
  By 1988 with the continued infusion of sporty Toyota <a href="toyota_twin_cam_article.html">TwinCam</a> 
  models in the U.S. market, Toysport was busy attending consumer and trade shows 
  and preparing magazine vehicles. The influx of more Japanese parts alleviated 
  the need to develop parts locally. At this time more than 60% of our inventory 
  were locally sourced, 30% were still imported, and the remaining parts were 
  Toysport proprietary products.<br>
        <br>
        In 1990 we purchased our present building. Just like the cars we worked
        on, we have continually upgraded the facility. Our showroom, which is in
        continuous changing flux, has the most comprehensive display of sports
        parts; our service facility prepares engines and prototype work
        non-stop; our engine and chassis dyno allow continuous engine tuning and
        development. Expanded foreign sales keep us busy identifying correct
        applications for foreign Toyota market models. We were exporting sports
        parts and accessories to Toyota enthusiasts and racers all over the
        world. Our expanded parts support for Old School and Milestone Toyota
        models has proven very successful and rewarding.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">We have aggressively imported more varieties of Toyota engines than
        Toyota dared to bring in. Two, Four, Five valve TwinCam engines. Turbo,
        Super-charged, and Twin-charged. Single plug and Twin plug. Street,
        Prototype, Rally, and Racing. Been there, done that. Toyota Technicians
        from the different Toyota Regional centers (in town for official Toyota
        corporate business) regularly visit to see engines and cars that they
        only read about and see in pictures. Toyota dealers call us for their
        customers’ special needs. Every year we tease Toyota employees with
        Toysport prepared vehicles in the Toyota Oktoberfest car show at Toyota
        headquarters.<br>
        <br>
        The performance aftermarket changed in the 90's, affecting Toyota's
        sports image seriously (and our business as a result). The sporty new
        models from Toyota stopped coming, current models disappeared, and
        Toyota lost it's following for new entry-level sports car buyers.
        Ironically, the sports aftermarket was expanding with all the other
        sporty and exotic offerings from other manufacturers. We participated in
        that boom. We tuned and modified a lot of Nissans, Mazdas, and Hondas-
        but we proudly kept our Toyota hat on.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">By 1995 it was clear that the strong popularity of sporty Toyotas to
        the consumers was gone. The Toyota diehards insisted in RWD and kept all
        the older RWD models rolling. The Toyota Turbo models trickled in but
        the widely based Corolla and Celica market was passed over by the sports
        minded consumers. Fortunately, we have managed to capture more of the
        Toyota specialty market. The different Toyota clubs send us membership
        business. Our resources for Toyota parts remain phenomenal and
        unbeatable.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Toyotas never die; they just get modified and restored. The Starlets,
        Corollas, Celicas, Supras, and MR2s continue to come for fresh power,
        suspension upgrades, or total restoration. Yes, the exotic 2000Gts,
        Sport 850s, Century, Crowns, and Soarers still come or call. Tercels,
        Camrys, and RAV4s are regulars. The pick-up truck and Land Cruiser
        market has never been our focus, but we have prepared the best ones for
        the magazines and won National Championships!</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Our expertise in Toyota tuning has opened other major venues. Our
        reputation led to some unsolicited factory contracts. We worked with
        Nissan Competition on some prototype turbo vehicles and raced Showroom
        Stock 300ZXs. We worked with Mazda in the introduction of the 2nd
        generation RX7 Turbo. We worked with Honda Research and Mugen on Honda
        turbos (when they were in their old Gardena location). Naturally no
        important information was shared. It was exciting times and a continuing
        learning process.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">We continued working with Toyotas and have turbocharged and modified
        more Toyota models, than any other company. We are honored to be &quot;a
        pioneer of the import high performance industry&quot;, for &quot;being
        around forever&quot;, as the &quot;premier Toyota aftermarket
        specialist&quot; and being &quot;the ultimate skunkworks for modified
        Toyotas&quot;. Yes, we have had to defend Toyota and Toyota products to
        non-<i>Toyotaphiles</i> (and unhappy Toyota owners). We are proud that our
        organization has maintained the longest continuous management effort of
        any Toyota tuning and sports parts related business. Magazines continue
        to give us editorial space despite remaining basically non-advertisers.<br>
        <br>
        Our business ties to past and current suppliers is one of mutual support
        and technical exchange. We have been the first distributor for TRD and
        HKS. Kaminari, PIAA, Tokico, Centerforce, Sway-Away, Momo, Suspension
        Techniques, Eibach- all used Toysport to help fit, test, and launch
        their products. We were early distributors for Greddy, K&N, Cibie,
        Mikuni, Recaro, Dough Thorley, and others</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Our friends, customers, and dealers in North and South America, the
        islands in the West Indies, the European Economic Community, and the
        deserts and oasis of the Middle East, the African continent, Australia,
        and all the nations in SE Asia- has given Toysport an international
        presence. We have associates in the Toyota Network- in the US, Japan,
        and the different foreign markets were Toyotas roam and race. Friends
        and former employees work in the different Toyota Race Teams, Corporate
        office, in the US and Worldwide.<br>
        <br>
        The Internet allows us to reach and service more Toyota customers. Our
        website is a frequent stop for Toyota enthusiasts. We are challenged to
        keep up with E-mail inquiries and requests. It has saved a lot on
        postage and long distance phone bills, more important it allowed a much
        faster and accurate order turnaround and better customer service. With
        our new distribution center in the Philippines, we will be able to serve
        all our international markets better, with additional product lines and
        expanded inventory levels.<br>
        <br>
        The next millennium, 2000, Toysport will celebrate 20 years of service
        to the Toyota enthusiasts in the U.S. The first 20 years have proven
        challenging but very rewarding. Our clientele base, which has changed
        demographically and geographically- has continued to grow. We have met
        so many enthusiasts, made so many friends, and faced so many different
        characters that a book can easily be filled with amusing and amazing
        stories. We thank all our past and current customers for making all this
        activities possible. We look forward to servicing new customers, making
        new friends, and helping everyone get the most out of their Toyotas. We
        welcome you to come join us.</font></p>
