    Toysport<br>
    </strong></font><font size="2" face="Arial"><br>
    In 1980 Toysport was established to distribute Toyota Racing
    Development (TRD) sport parts. Working as in-house consultant
    for TRD USA, Toysport initiated the &quot;grass-root&quot;
    support program for Toyota racers. The program evolved into
    Toyota's Contingency Program, when Toyota USA formed Toyota
    Motorsport in 1981. Ever since the beginning Toysport has
    actively supported Toyota USA's corporate goals.<br>
    <br>
    Team Toysport America Limited was incorporated in 1982.
    Toysport supported and complemented the activities of Toyota
    Motorsport and TRD USA. Toysport handled vehicle preparation
    for Toyota shows and events. Toysport also prepared all
    magazine cars for TRD USA and Toyota Public Relations.
    (Overseas, the principals of Toysport has worked with Toyota
    since 1965, and TOSCO (the original corporate name of TRD in
    Japan) since 1972. <br>
    <br>
    The initial thrust of Toysport was engine development and
    accessory distribution. Working with &quot;privateer&quot;
    Toyota racing teams and U.S. aftermarket manufacturers
    allowed for the diverse and thorough coverage for sports
    parts and competition preparation. Toysport's commitment to
    Toyota racers and enthusiasts was total and encompassing.
    This commitment earned us the cooperation of Toyota, the
    manufacturers and importers. Toysport has worked continually
    in expanding and developing our product lines. Affiliated
    businesses have also responded to our needs by adding and
    supplementing our product lines on a continuing basis. This
    evolved into Toysport becoming a Toyota Tuning Specialist.
    Upgrade was our creed.<br>
    <br>
    By 1985 Toysport had achieved the highest level of product
    and technical support for Toyota enthusiasts. From the
    leading winners in Toyota's contingency program to the top
    Toyota Racing Team (Tom's Racing of Japan), Toysport was
    actively involved in Motorsport activities. Our customers
    were entered in various SCCA, IMSA, SCORE and HDRA events.
    Our customers have won National championships for Toyota.
    Toysport entered international FIA sanctioned events and
    always placed in the top two positions in their classes, a
    perfect record. Track records were also set in the U.S.<br>
    <br>
    Attention away from Motorsport activities was a result of the
    tremendous business in the Toyota aftermarket. 1985 and 1986
    model years saw the strongest Toyota sports model line-up in
    U.S. Toyota history. This started in 1972 with the Celica and
    SR5 Corollas, both milestone cars. The Toyota 4X4 Truck
    business started in 1979 added to the frenzy. The
    introduction of the 3rd generation Celica GTS and Supra in
    1982 greatly expanded the business. The arrival of the Twin
    Cam Corollas and MR2 in 1985 was followed by Turbo models-
    Toyota enthusiasts were everywhere, and Toysport was
    Paradise.<br>
    <br>
    By 1988 with the continued infusion of sporty Toyota models
    in the market, Toysport was busy attending consumer and trade
    shows and preparing magazine vehicles. The influx of more
    Japanese parts alleviated the need to develop parts locally.
    At this time more than 60% of our inventory were locally
    sourced, 30% were still imported, and the remaining parts
    were proprietary produced.<br>
    <br>
    In 1990 we purchased our present building. Just like the cars
    we worked on, we have continually upgraded the facility. Our
    showroom, which is in continuos changing flux, has the most
    comprehensive display of sports parts; our service facility
    prepares engines and prototype work non-stop; our engine and
    chassis dyno allow continuous engine tuning and development.
    Expanded foreign sales keep us busy identifying correct
    applications for foreign Toyota market models. We were
    exporting sports parts to Toyota racers and accessories to
    Toyota enthusiasts all over the world. Our expanded parts
    support for Old School and Milestone Toyota models has proven
    very successful and rewarding.<br>
    <br>
    The performance aftermarket changed in the 90's, affecting
    Toyota's sports image seriously (and our business as a
    result). The sporty new models from Toyota stopped coming,
    current models disappeared, and Toyota lost it's following
    for new entry-level sports car buyers. Ironically, the sports
    aftermarket was expanding with all the other sporty and
    exotic offerings from other manufacturers. We participated in
    that boom. We tuned and modified a lot of Nissans, Mazdas,
    and Hondas- but we proudly kept our Toyota hat on. By 1992 it
    was clear that the early popularity for sporty Toyotas by the
    consumers was gone. The Toyota diehards insisted in RWD and
    kept all the older RWD models rolling. The Toyota Turbo
    models trickled in but the widely based Corolla and Celica
    market was passed over by the sports minded consumers. <br>
    <br>
    But Toyota sold more cars anyway! Toyota's US Motorsport
    Manager did a good job, but Product Planning lost it. Toyota
    Corporate in Japan has the TEN plan, but that is another
    story. There is a new group in Toyota trying
    to&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;..but that is still another story.<br>
    <br>
    Our expertise in tuning has opened other major venues. Our
    reputation led to some unsolicited contracts. We worked with
    Nissan Competition on some prototype turbo vehicles and
    Showroom Stock 300ZXs. We worked with Mazda in the
    introduction of the 2nd generation RX7 Turbo. We worked with
    Honda Research and Mugen on Honda turbos (when they were in
    their old Gardena location). Naturally no important
    information was shared. It was exciting times and a
    continuing learning process. We continued playing with our
    Toyotas and have turbocharged and modified more Toyota
    models, than any other company. <br>
    <br>
    We are honored to be &quot;a pioneer of the import high
    performance industry&quot;, for &quot;being around
    forever&quot;, as the &quot;premier Toyota aftermarket
    specialist&quot; and being &quot;the ultimate skunkworks for
    modified Toyotas&quot;. We have had to defend Toyota and
    Toyota products to non-Toyotaphiles and unhappy Toyota
    owners. We are proud that our organization has maintained the
    longest continuos management effort of any Toyota sports
    parts related business. Several times we were offered and
    tempted with a buy-out! But we love our work and we intend to
    stay.<br>
    <br>
    Our business ties to past and current suppliers is one of
    mutual support and technical exchange. We have been the first
    distributor for TRD and HKS. Kaminari, PIAA, Tokico,
    Centerforce, Sway-Away, Momo, Eibach- all used Toysport to
    help fit, test, and launch their products. We were early
    distributors for Greddy, K&N, Cibie, Mikuni, Recaro,
    Dough Thorley, and others. Some others have gone out of
    business. Magazines continue to give us editorial space
    despite remaining basically non-advertisers. The different
    Toyota clubs send us membership business. <br>
    <br>
    Instead of growing old, we have managed to stay young, or at
    least tried. The loss of Toyota models adaptable to tuning,
    made engine transplants a bigger part of the business.
    Fortunately, we have managed to capture more of the Toyota
    specialty market. Our resources for Toyota parts is
    phenomenal and unbeatable. We have Toyota parts made of-
    unobtanium. Our best selling product- Toysport stickers!! <br>
    <br>
    Toyotas never die, they just get modified and restored. The
    Starlets, Corollas, Celicas, Supras, and MR2s continue to
    come for fresh power, suspension upgrades, or total
    restoration. Yes, the exotic 2000Gts, Sport 850s, Century,
    Crowns, and Soarers still come or call. Tercels, Camrys, and
    RAV4s are regulars. The pick-up truck and Land Cruiser market
    has never been strong for us, but we have prepared the best
    ones for the magazines and won National Championships! <br>
    <br>
    We have aggressively imported more varieties of Toyota
    engines than Toyota dared to bring in. Two, Four, Five valve
    TwinCam engines. Turbo, Super-charged, and Twincharged.
    Single plug and Twin plug. Prototype, Rally, and Racing. Been
    there, done that. Toyota Technicians from the different
    Toyota Regional centers (who are in town for official Toyota
    corporate business) regularly visit to see engines that they
    only read about and see in pictures. Every year we tease
    Toyota employees with Toysport prepared vehicles in the
    Toyota Oktoberfest car show at Toyota headquarters. <br>
    <br>
    We have friends, customers, and dealers in North and South
    America, the Economic Union of Europe, and the desert fields
    and oasis in the Middle East, the African continent,
    Toyota-crazy Australia, and all the nations in SE Asia. We
    have associates in the Toyota Network- here in the US, Japan,
    and all the different international markets were Toyotas roam
    and race. Former employees and friends work in the different
    Toyota Race Teams, in the U.S. and Japan.<br>
    <br>
    The Internet allows us to reach and service more customers.
    We are challenged to keep up with E-mail inquiries and
    requests. It has saved a lot of postage and long distance
    phone bills, more important it allowed a much faster order
    turnaround and better customer service. With our new
    distribution center in the Philippines, we will be able to
    serve all our international markets better, with additional
    product lines and expanded inventory levels. <br>
    <br>
    The next millennium, next year, 2000 Toysport will celebrate
    20 years of service to the Toyota enthusiasts in the U.S. The
    last 20 years have proven very challenging but rewarding. Our
    clientele base, which has changed demographically and
    geographically- has continued to grow. We have met so many
    enthusiasts, made so many friends, and faced so many
    different characters that a book can easily be filled with
    amusing and amazing stories. We thank all our past and
    current customers for making all this activities possible. We
    look forward to servicing new customers, making new friends,
    and helping everyone get the most out of their Toyotas.<br>
