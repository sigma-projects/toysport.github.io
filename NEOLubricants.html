<p><font size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><span style="font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">From 
  a youthful interest in a ..neighborhood sprint car to a genuine ..concern regarding 
  the limitations of ..existing oil products, Paul Baker has ..developed the NEO 
  SYNTHETIC OIL ..COMPANY to meet the ever changing ..needs of the automotive 
  industry.</span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><o:p> </o:p> </span></span></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><span style="font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Back 
  in the 80's, even the major oil ..companies held the philosophy that ..in ..order 
  to improve an oil product's performance, they needed to thicken the product. 
  Paul realized that what was needed was a stronger product - not necessarily 
  a heavier product - thicker was not better ! He decided to take his existing 
  oil and experiment with some of the additives available at that time. </span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><o:p> </o:p> </span></span></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><span style="font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">To 
  his satisfaction, he began to see improvement, strengthening his belief that 
  thinner oils were the key. Following his introduction to the synthetic oils 
  being experimented with in the military, Paul saw a new direction in the development 
  of synthetic oil for racing and automotive applications - thus NEO SYNTHETIC 
  OIL was born</span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><o:p> 
  </o:p> </span></span></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><span style="font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Success 
  in motorsports has been a major part of NEO's history, and is certain to be 
  a major part of its future. The 2-cycle oil NEO developed for Mercury Marine 
  helped bring Betty Cook her two world championships. NEO has also helped set 
  land speed records - including the fastest Harley Davidson (set at Bonneville). 
  NEO helped Dale Armstrong engines set their hall of fame records. Over 50% of 
  the European Formula 1 cars use some type of NEO product, and NEO helped the 
  Draco team win two GM Lotus Euro Series Championships. By 1987, every Indy Car 
  that ran a March Engineering Gear Box at Indy used the gear oils and CV joint 
  lubrications developed by NEO.</span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><o:p> 
  </o:p></span></span></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><span style="font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">A 
  major breakthrough for NEO came in the late '80's with the development of the 
  &quot;0&quot; weight lubrication. A tribute to the value of this oil comes from 
  the owners and drivers of the engines using this oil who state their engines 
  look better after running this &quot;0&quot; weight oil than prior to doing 
  so, and &quot;0&quot; weight helped Formula Ford win the Canadian Championship 
  !</span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><o:p> </o:p> </span></span></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><span style="font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">And 
  now, as we approach the 21st century, NEO is proud to be the official and only 
  lubricant recommended by X-Trac for all their gearboxes and was used by 8 out 
  of the top ten finishers at Lemans in 1999.</span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><o:p> 
  </o:p> </span></span></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><span style="font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The 
  future of NEO holds unlimited possibilities in the development of all types 
  of synthetic lubrication. Products to watch include the CV joint grease as used 
  by the Williams' Formula I Team and the wheel bearing grease currently being 
  tested by both Jaguar and Williams. NEO.is working on a gear box oil for use 
  behind the 6OO - 7OOHP engines currently being run in European&nbsp; GT racing. 
  BMW is only one of the many companies looking at NEO products for use in their 
  racing vehicles...Long term, NEO hopes to develop a product for engines involved 
  in the greater horsepower - longer duration races.</span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><o:p> 
  </o:p></span></span></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><span style="font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Above 
  all, Paul and the staff at NEO continue to listen and be involved with leaders 
  in the industry, so you can be assured that when a new lubricant is needed, 
  NEO will be in the forefront of its development.</span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><o:p>
