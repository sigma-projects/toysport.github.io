<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">The 7 Series M engine was the last of the M
blocks. The evolution from a 2000cc SOHC in-line 6 cylinder to a 3000cc DOHC 24
valve saw this engine family powering Toyota’s top of the line cars for over
30 years. Before retiring this series block Toyota saw it fit to crown the block
with an impressive 24 valve head.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Following Toyota’s pattern of evolutionary
engine development, the 7MG was a trouble free design- except for the cylinder
head gasket problem. In both turbo and non-turbo varieties, the gaskets tend to
start failing as early as 80,000. It does not matter wether the cars were either
driven extremely hard or easy. Maximum mileage is from normally used engines,
some of which survived to 150,000!</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">The bottom line is that these engines can survive
all the horsepower you set it up for as long as you are aware of the maintenance
requirement it needs (head gasket). Keep a fresh gasket on hand and it is
capable of producing a lot of power.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">The later model engines came with the Lexus style
oil-filled mounts. The slight horsepower increase in the latter models came from
computer tuning and exhaust differences. Internally they are identical.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">In competition the 7MGT was handicapped by the
heavy Supra body. Although it won numerous races- there was no major titles for
this engine. Thanks to Japanese tuners (HKS, Greddy, Blitz) the street Toyota
denizens ruled over the competitive models from other manufacturers. In it’s
class and generation the 7MG was the engine. This same power potential led us to
power older Supras, RWD Celicas, some pick-ups, even a cigarette boat- with
these engines.</font></b></p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000FF">Modifying the 7MG / 7MGTE:</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">BLOCK: The
block is trouble-free, but will not tolerate low oil conditions. It is a very
robust bottom end that will survive mega horsepower engine build-ups. Since it
is a long crankshaft, crack testing is mandatory between rebuilds. The con-rod
small end should also be rebushed because they are subject to a lot of stress.
Maximum bore should be limited to 85.5mm.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">For normally aspirated engines compression can be
raised to a maximum 12.5 compression, after which the dome design starts
interfering with the combustion air-flow. For turbo set-up the compression can
be set as low as 8.0:1. The original pistons did not benefit from later Toyota
practice of piston coating, so for any major projects forged pistons are the
only ticket.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Although the engine is able to rev high and the
bottom end will survive high RPMs, heavy continuous boost conditions past 16psi
will eventually warp the heads. Judicious use of boosts up to 30psi is not
uncommon and survivable.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">The block decks should be resurfaced to the best
finish available. Invariably the head gasket will have gouged the surface. Make
sure that the aluminum timing cover is on the block when the deck is surfaced,
or else the head gasket will not seal properly. We send the blocks and head to a
special grinding outfit- that machines aircraft components, and they are able to
surface to a mirror finish. Upgrade all the engine assembly bolts. Replace all
the hoses. Keep a spare head gasket.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">CYLINDER HEAD:
The 24 valve head is trouble free, but should be checked for warpage. There is a
common propensity for the aluminum head to deteriorate around the water
passages. Use the best anti-freeze you can get- more heads become unusable
because of material erosion and decomposition- rather than cracking or warpage.
The intake and exhaust ports can be cleaned up, but port and polishing is not
mandatory- there are other pieces you can spend on that will return more
horsepower for the budget.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Camshafts and adjustable gears are available to
maximize the full potential of these 24 valve heads. Do not use cams over 280
degrees since the lower cylinder pressure will cause erratic inputs to the ECU.
On the turbo models, the use of NA cams is an easy upgrade, if you can find
them. In the cam journals to the head, there is a soft leadlike coating that is
normally scoured. We have successfully polished of all coating into the bare
journal and reused the cams with no problems.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">The valve seals on some engines harden abnormally
soon, sometimes even before the head gasket bows out. Replace the valve seals
when you do a head gasket replacement. Again surfacing (like the block) to the
best finish is mandatory. Use an aftermarket metal headgasket for maximum
mileage in between teardowns.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">FUEL SYSTEM:
The stock fuel system for the NA and turbo models is adequate. For heavy turbo
modifications please read the next section. The VPC designed for the 7MGT can
also be used on the NA, an exclusive Toysport modification. This eliminates the
air-flow meter and does wonders for throttle response and boost transition. For
additional capacity there are 550cc injectors that will drop-in; use a JZA80
(Twin Turbo) fuel pump that is a direct replacement.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">TURBO UPGRADE:
The factory turbo is able to run boosts up to 14 psi (1 bar). Trying to boost
above this is plain useless. In order of importance- the exhaust, intercooler,
boost controller, ignition, fuel computer, turbo, vein pressure converter,
injectors are the steps in upgrading. For anything over 14 psi a new block with
forged pistons is necessary. Adjusting compression ratio for a non-turbo being
upgraded to turbo, by the head gasket is not recommended.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">The availability of metal head gaskets in various
thickness and composition is more to compensate for the milling of the head and
block, and slight adjustments in compression. There are 3 types of aftermarket
metal headgaskets available- Stopper, Bead, and Grommet. The Stopper is a
multi-layer set-up that will survive better than a factory gasket. The Bead has
also multi-layer and is a more flexible and has a raised bead to help seal
around the pistons. The Grommet has an additional seal ring, (like the factory
units) and will take the most abuse.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">The most usable turbo upgrade is based on the
CT26 stock turbo. We were the first company to do this and maintain proprietary
specifications. Some companies also do upgrades, but we are certain our set-up
is the best. A twin turbo set-up is available, that makes the engine
dramatically responsive and powerful- this is based on HKS TwinTurbo set-up on
the old 5MG. There are numerous other single turbo set-ups, but they are not
streetable.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">IGNITION SYSTEM:
The simplest most effective ignition upgrade for either NA or Turbo, are the HKS
Twin Power (there are two different units). Do not even think of something else.
The MSD or NGK wires also work very well as upgrades to factory wires.</font></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<font face="Arial">
<p><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#0000FF"><b>Some Recommended Set-ups:</b></font></p>
</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">For stock configuration: The 7MGE/TE are common
engines that reputable import shops, should be able to service. Machining engine
components should be only trusted to known machine shops, since tolerance limits
are crucial and very specific. Domestic machine shops, used to Detroit
specifications, will not be able to properly service the requirements. There are
several good overhauling gasket sets aside from factory- which are equal to the
factory issue, but as a minimum use only factory original headgasket. Replacing
the exhaust (on both models) produce instant power, the factory units
&quot;crimp&quot; right under the axles- which the aftermarket units are able to
maintain the full diameter.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">For modified configuration: For normally
aspirated models, mild cams, headers and a good exhaust produce expected
results. To build a high compression model, stay within 12.5:1 compression (but
you may need octane booster on really hot days. Do not expect to reach turbo
power levels. For turbo models, re-read the Turbo Upgrade section. There were a
lot of magazines that covered different set-ups- read between the lines. You
will find that some articles contradict other articles! Enough said.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">For racing configuration: Use the older Supra
body, or remove everything bolted inside the car. More seriously- the engine is
capable but the weight penalty does not make this vehicle competitive in all out
racing. For milder competition like, Club Rallying or Road Racing- a properly
set-up Turbo will be close to unbeatable, plus you will be cruising comfortably
too.</font></b></p>
