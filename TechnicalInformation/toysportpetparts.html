<p><font size="3">Toysport has listed various engine components manufactured for
us by the leading suppliers of Pistons, Rods, Valves, Turbos, etc.…. These
sports parts incorporate unique and proprietary product specifications that Toysport has
designed into these components. We have identified some manufacturers to show the
source of the products. Toysport products will be different from what the
manufacturers would
normally sell directly to the public or other vendors. In most cases the
products will not work, as designed, with other components from other sources or
even from the same manufacturer. We custom order our parts to support inventory
levels and in quantity to avail of volume pricing.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">When we sell engine component parts, we always ask the customers,
what other parts they are using. Naturally choosing and matching components is the
most important first step in any engine or project build-up. The success and
failure of your project will depend on proper planning.</font></p>
