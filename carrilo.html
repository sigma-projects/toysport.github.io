  Industries got its start in 1963 when Fred Carrillo saw a need for dependable, 
  high quality connecting rods for the high-performance racing industry. Many 
  parts of the internal combustion engine are susceptible to failure, but one 
  of the most susceptible is the connecting rod. The connecting rod transfers 
  energy from the engine, to the crankshaft, and ultimately to the final drive 
  mechanisms. A failed connecting rod can result in a lost race and the potential 
  destruction of a very expensive piece of machinery. Since the conception of 
  the connecting rod business,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Carrillo 
  Industries have been dedicated to precision and quality construction. Their 
  design goal for every rod made to maximize strength and durability while minimizing 
  weight. Carrillo's experience with engines is based on several decades of active 
  participation in competition with motorcycles, dragsters, straight-aways and 
  predominantly championship cars. Combining aerospace background with years of 
  experience in competitive racing, to design and manufacture the most durable 
  and long-lasting connecting rod<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Carillo 
  products endure even the most severe conditions produced during high performance 
  competition. <b><o:p> </o:p> </b></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">Fatigue 
  is the major cause of connecting rod failure. At Carrillo Industries, proprietary 
  steel, manufactured and forged to custom specifications are used.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span>After experimenting with virtually every other reasonable material, this 
  chromium / nickel / vanadium / molybdenum FORGED alloy is used exclusively to 
  meet stringent requirements for strength and durability.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span>Carillo connecting rods are fully machined to guarantee the removal of 
  all surface imperfections in the forging. After heat treatment, each connecting 
  rod is 100% magnaflux inspected and hardness checked, then machined to final 
  size. Each set of rods is balanced and then shot peened to achieve the ultimate 
  in strength and fatigue properties. <b><o:p> </o:p> </b></font></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">One 
  of the most susceptible points of failure in conventionally designed connecting 
  rods is the fastener system. At Carrillo, a great deal of effort is excerted 
  into developing rod bolts for specific applications. This effort has led to 
  the utilization of four different bolt designs. The largest bolt available is 
  a 7/16 inch diameter thread, fabricated either from AISI H11 tool steel or Multiphase<sup>®</sup> 
  material. Many questions are directed regarding proper bolt selection. Briefly, 
  the H11 bolt (WMC7 and WMC6) is a high quality, aircraft standard fastener, 
  applicable to most high performance uses. Under racing conditions, we suggest 
  that the H11 bolts be changed periodically. In comparison, the Multiphase<sup>®</sup> 
  bolt (SPS-CARR) is designed to be a non-replacement type fastener. </font></span></font></p>
