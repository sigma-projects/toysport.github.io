<span style="font-size: 10pt">From the racetrack to the street, Toyota Racing 
Development (TRD) U.S.A., Inc. plays a key role in providing Toyota with an 
enhanced performance image. A subsidiary of Toyota Motor Sales (TMS), U.S.A., 
Inc., TRD designs and builds Toyota racing engines in addition to building and 
marketing performance aftermarket parts for many Toyota vehicles. <br>

Keeping pace with Motorsports and the performance aftermarket industry in the 
U.S., TRD has grown from fewer than 50 associates in early 1995 to more than 200 
today. TRD’s Championship Auto Racing Team (CART) and Indy Racing League (IRL) 
engine division is housed in a 47,000 square foot Costa Mesa, CA facility, 
complete with four engine dynamometers, an engine assembly workshop, an engine 
design studio, and several specialized workshops. Within this state-of-the-art 
facility, highly skilled TRD engineers and technicians design, assemble, and 
develop Toyota’s CART and IRL racing engines. <br>
<br>
TRD’s Sales and Special Projects Division is housed separately, in a 45,000 
square foot Tustin, CA facility. In this dedicated facility, TRD develops, 
inventories and markets a variety of sport parts designed to enhance the driving 
experience for Toyota owners. Also from the Tustin facility, TRD’s Special 
Projects group assembles and develops Toyota racing engines for Off-Road, Sports 
Car, Toyota Atlantic, and Nascar DASH series competition. <br>

reputation on the rough roads, smooth asphalt and snowy tracks of the World 
Rally Championship, Toyota Motorsport, operating as Toyota Team Europe, has 
become the central point for Toyota's motorsport involvement based in Europe. 
The design, construction and operation of the Corolla WRC and Toyota GT-One 
entry in Le Mans are the pinnacles of the company's operations, which also 
includes touring car success and a wide-ranging after-sales division. TTE is 
based in an impressive, hi-tech, 17,000 sqm facility in Köln, Germany, and 
employs 300 people. In 1997, it became the first motorsports business in the
