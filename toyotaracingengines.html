  official Toyota Race Engines come from one source- TMC (Toyota Motor Corporation 
  Japan).<o:p> </o:p> </font></b></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">The 
  early beginning of Toyota motorsport involvement started with 4 engineers working 
  on production based engines.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Experimentation and experience led to the production of the 
  first<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Toyota Twin Cams- the 3M 
  and 9R.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 3M powered the 2000GT 
  and the 9R powered the Corona 1600 GT.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The first race engines were prepared in-house by TMC’s Group 7 section 
  (manufacturing not racing!), starting in the late 60’s to early 70’s.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span><o:p> </o:p> </font></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">In 
  1968 Toyota released it’s first race engine- a 3000cc V8, 2-vavle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The next year the engine became a 5000cc V8 4 valve.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>(A full 20 years before the Lexus LS 400 / Toyota Celsior!)<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>In another year the engine received Twin Turbos.<o:p> </o:p> 
  </font></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">The 
  early race engines were based on the K and T series Corolla / Celica street 
  engines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Group 7 engineers 
  and mechanics also developed the original racing twin cam models, 2TG (100E) 
  and 18RG. These early Twin Cam engines were later issued with 16 valve heads 
  with highly modified stock blocks- 151E (2TG) and 152E (18RG), and a 16 valve 
  Twin Cam 3K too!– these were the first engines developed and assembled by TRD 
  (formerly known as TOSCO). <o:p> </o:p> </font></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">TRD 
  (Technocraft) has been the official parts outlet for TMC produced race related 
  hardware. Initial development of the 4TGTE and later development of the 503 
  (after IMSA) were also done in-house at TRD.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>TRD supplies the FIA and JICA all the homologation specifications for 
  all Toyota vehicles.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>TRD also supports the Japan only Formula Toyota 4AG 20Valve 
  spec engines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The TRD SPORTS PARTS 
  line is distributed worldwide by TRD (Technocraft).<o:p> </o:p> </font></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">TMC 
  supplied TTE (Toyota Team Europe) with base engines that TTE further developed 
  under Toyota Europe contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>TTE had their own specifications for the 2TG, 18RG, 152E, 4TGTE, 
  3SGTE, and some 7MGTEs, but the basic production based blocks and heads were 
  from TMC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 1998 and 1999 Le 
  Mans engines were also produced by TMC and developed by TTE. During the last 
  two (and final) appearances of Toyota in Le Mans- these engines powered the 
  fastest cars in the event.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 
  new F1 project is a totally new project fully funded by TMC and jointly being 
  developed by TMG (Toyota Motorsport GmbH)- the new name for TTE.<o:p> </o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">TMC 
  directly supplied some Japanese Toyota Race Teams with fully built engines (TOM’s, 
  TRUST, SARD, …… ) that these race teams further tuned externally.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Through the years, engines supplied included the original 2TG/18RG based 
  race units, the 16 valve 150 versions, the 4TGTEs, and the 503E engines. Previously 
  used in Le Mans, the 503Es are currently used in the Japan Touring Series.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The TOM’s developed production-based 3SGEs are the most successful 
  versions of the engine series (in Formula racing applications) are not TMC issue.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">TRD 
  USA further developed the 152Es to 2100cc. (IMSA GTU and SCORE/HDRA), the interim 
  4TGTEs (IMSA GTO), produced the most famous 503Es (IMSA GTP / Pikes Peak), and 
  the world-renowned Formula Atlantic engines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The spec series Atlantic engines are sold as kits to accredited engine 
  assemblers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The current RV8E 
  CART engines are supplied by TMC but developed, assembled, and tuned exclusively 
  by TRD USA. TRD supplies complete engines to the contracted Toyota CART teams.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Modified 5VZ for NASCAR is also under development and testing. The current 
  aluminum truck race engines are assembled and developed in-house at TRD USA.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>TRD USA distributes it’s own line of Sports Parts and Accessories, intended 
  exclusively for the U.S. models and market.<o:p> </o:p> </font></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">There 
  are some official issued engine designations and specifications- but they are 
  not accurate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Usually the specifications 
  are based on the original design versions and for promotional information use 
  only.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For obvious reasons, the 
  specifications announced are only representative of the race engine model- as 
  supplied to FIA or the sanctioning group.<o:p> </o:p> </font></span></font></p>
